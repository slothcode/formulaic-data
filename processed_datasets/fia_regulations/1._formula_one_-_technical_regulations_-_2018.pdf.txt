ARTICLE 2 : GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

2.1 Role of the FIA : 

 The following technical regulations for Formula One cars are issued by the FIA. 

2.2 Amendments to the regulations : 

 These Technical Regulations apply to the Championship taking place in the calendar year 
referred to in the title (“the Championship”) and may only be changed after 30 April of the 
preceding year with the unanimous agreement of all competitors, save for changes made by 
the FIA for safety reasons which may come into effect without notice or delay. 

2.3 Dangerous construction : 

 The stewards may exclude a vehicle whose construction is deemed to be dangerous. 

2.4 Compliance with the regulations : 

 Automobiles must comply with these regulations in their entirety at all times during an Event. 

 Should a competitor introduce a new design or system or feel that any aspect of these 
regulations is unclear, clarification may be sought from the FIA Formula One Technical 
Department. If clarification relates to any new design or system, correspondence must 
include: 

 a) A full description of the design or system. 

 b) Drawings or schematics where appropriate. 

 c) The competitor's opinion concerning the immediate implications on other parts of the 
car of any proposed new design. 

 d) The competitor's opinion concerning any possible long term consequences or new 
developments which may come from using any such new designs or systems. 

 e) The precise way or ways in which the competitor feels the new design or system will 
enhance the performance of the car. 

2.5 New systems or technologies : 

 Any new system, procedure or technology not specifically covered by these regulations, but 
which is deemed permissible by the FIA Formula One Technical Department, will only be 
admitted until the end of the Championship during which it is introduced. Following this the 
Formula One Commission will be asked to review the technology concerned and, if they feel it 
adds no value to Formula One in general, it will be specifically prohibited. 

 Any team whose technology is prohibited in this way will then be required to publish full 
technical details of the relevant system or procedure. 

2.6 Measurements : 

 All measurements must be made while the car is stationary on a flat horizontal surface. 

2.7 Duty of Competitor : 

 It is the duty of each competitor to satisfy the FIA technical delegate and the stewards that his 
automobile complies with these regulations in their entirety at all times during an Event. 

 The design of the car, its components and systems shall, with the exception of safety features, 
demonstrate their compliance with these regulations by means of physical inspection of 
hardware or materials. No mechanical design may rely upon software inspection as a means of 
ensuring its compliance.

3.6.1 Height 

No part of the bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line may be more than 800mm above 
the reference plane. 

3.6.2 Width 

a)  The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and more than 450mm above 
the reference plane must not exceed 950mm. 

b) The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and between 200mm and 
450mm above the reference plane must not exceed 840mm. 

3.6.3 Rear wing profiles 

Other than the bodywork defined in Article 3.6.6, any bodywork behind the rear wheel centre 
line which is more than 600mm above the reference plane, and less than 455mm from the car 
centre plane, must lie in an area when viewed from the side of the car that is situated 
between 150mm and 500mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line. 

With the exception of the bodywork associated with adjustment of the section in accordance 
with Article 3.6.8: 

 a) When viewed from the side of the car, no longitudinal vertical cross section may have 
more than two sections in this area, each of which must be closed. 

 b) No part of these longitudinal vertical cross sections in contact with the external air 
stream may have a local concave radius of curvature smaller than 100mm. 

 Any bodywork associated with the adjustment of the rearmost section in accordance with 
Article 3.6.8 must be located either less than 25mm from the longitudinal centre line of car or 
more than 450mm from the longitudinal centreline of the car. 

 Once the rearmost and uppermost section is defined, ‘gurney’ type trim tabs may be fitted to 
the trailing edge. When measured in any longitudinal vertical cross section no dimension of 
any such trim tab may exceed 20mm. 

 The chord of the rearmost and uppermost closed section must always be smaller than the 
chord of the lowermost section at the same lateral station. 

 Furthermore, the distance between adjacent sections at any longitudinal vertical plane must

3.6.4 Separators 

In order to ensure that the individual profiles and the relationship between these two sections 
can only change whilst the car is in motion in accordance with Article 3.6.8, they must be 
bridged by means of pairs of rigid impervious supports arranged such that no part of the 
trailing edge of the forward section may be more than 250mm laterally from a pair of 
supports. These pairs of supports must : 

 a) Be located no more than 455mm from the car centre plane. 

 b) Fully enclose each complete section such that their inner profiles match that of each 
section. With the exception of minimal local changes where the two sections are 
adjacent to each other, their outer profiles must be offset from the inner profiles by 
between 8mm and 30mm and may not incorporate any radius smaller than 10mm 
(‘gurney’ type trim tabs may however be fitted between the supports). 

 c) Be aligned as a pair so as to provide a bearing across their full thickness and along a 
profile length of at least 10mm when the distance between the two sections is at its 
closest position. 

 d) Not be recessed into the wing profiles (where a recess is defined as a reduction in 
section at a rate greater than 45° with respect to a lateral axis). 

 e) Be arranged so that any curvature occurs only in a horizontal plane (other than when 
this bodywork is adjusted in accordance with Article 3.6.8). 

 f) Be between 2mm and 5mm thick. 

 g) Be rigidly fixed to their respective sections. 

 h) Be constructed from a material with modulus greater than 50GPa. 

 These supports will be ignored when assessing whether the car is in compliance with Articles 
3.6.1, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 3.6.6 and 3.6.7. 

3.6.5 Rear impact structure 

Any parts of the car less than 100mm from the car centre plane and more than 500mm behind 
the rear wheel centre line must be situated between 200mm and 400mm above the reference 
plane. 

With the exception of the last 150mm of the tailpipes described in Article 5.8, there must be

behind the rear wheel centre line and between 400mm and 550mm above the reference 
plane. 

3.6.6 Pylons 

Any horizontal section between 550mm and 600mm above the reference plane, taken 
through bodywork located rearward of a point lying 50mm forward of the rear wheel centre 
line and less than 100mm from the car centre plane, may contain no more than two closed 
symmetrical sections with a maximum total area of 5000mm². The thickness of each section 
may not exceed 25mm when measured perpendicular to the car centre plane. 

 Once fully defined, the section at 595mm above the reference plane may be extruded 
upwards to join the sections defined in Article 3.6.3. A fillet radius no greater than 10mm may 
be used where these sections join. 

3.6.7 Endplates 

a) In side view, the projected area of any bodywork lying between 300mm and 800mm

plane, and between 200mm and 600mm above the reference plane must lie in an area 
more than 400mm from the car centre plane. On any horizontal section through the 
bodywork in this area, at any given longitudinal position along this section, the distance 
between the inner and outer surfaces must not exceed 20mm measured perpendicular 
to the car centreline. 

c)  In side view, no bodywork rearward of the rear wheel centre line, and between 100mm 
and 475mm from the car centre plane, may be situated vertically above a diagonal line

the rear wheel centre line and the rearward point 800mm above the reference plane 
and 710mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line. 

3.6.8 Drag reduction system (DRS) 

The incidence of the rearmost and uppermost closed section described in Article 3.6.3 may be 
varied whilst the car is in motion provided : 

 a) It comprises only one component that must be symmetrically arranged about the car 
centre plane with a minimum width of 908mm. 

 b) With the exception of minimal parts solely associated with adjustment of the section, 
no parts of the section in contact with the external airstream may be located any more 
than 455mm from the car centre plane. 

 c) With the exception of any minimal parts solely associated with adjustment of the 
rearmost and uppermost section, two closed sections are used in the area described in 
Article 3.6.3. 

 d) Any such variation of incidence maintains compliance with all of the bodywork 
regulations. 

 e) It cannot be used to change the geometry of any duct, either directly or indirectly, other 
than the change to the distance between adjacent sections permitted by Article 3.6.3.. 

 f) When viewed from the side of the car at any longitudinal vertical cross section, the 
physical point of rotation of the rearmost and uppermost closed section must be fixed 
and located no more than 20mm below the upper extremity and no more than 20mm 
forward of the rear extremity of the area described in Article 3.6.3 at all times. 

 g) The design is such that failure of the system will result in the uppermost closed section 
returning to the normal high incidence position.

3.7 Floor and diffuser 

 Compliance with this Article must be demonstrated with all unsprung parts of the car 
removed. 

3.7.1 Step and reference planes 

With the parts referred to in Articles 3.7.10, 3.7.11 and 3.7.12 removed all sprung parts of the 
car situated from 430mm behind the front wheel centre line to 175mm in front of the rear 
wheel centre line, and which are visible from underneath, must form surfaces which lie on one 
of two parallel planes, the reference plane or the step plane. This does not apply to any parts 
of rear view mirrors which are visible, provided each of these areas does not exceed 
16000mm² when projected to a horizontal plane above the car. 

 The step plane must be 50mm above the reference plane. 

Additionally, the surface formed by all parts lying on the reference plane must : 

 a) Cover the area which is bounded by two transversal lines, one 430mm behind the front 
wheel centre line and the other on the rear wheel centre line, and two longitudinal lines 
150mm either side of the car centre plane. 

 b) Have a maximum width of 500mm. 

 c) Be symmetrical about the car centre plane. 

 d) Have a 50mm radius (+/-2mm) on each front corner when viewed from directly beneath 
the car, this being applied after the surface has been defined. 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 29/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

3.7.2 Transition 

The surface lying on the reference plane must be joined around its periphery to the surfaces 
lying on the step plane by a vertical transition. If there is no surface visible on the step plane 
vertically above any point around the periphery of the reference plane, this transition is not 
necessary. 

3.7.3 Boundaries 

The surface lying on the reference plane may be curved upwards at its boundaries with an arc 
of constant curvature whose radius of curvature is no greater than 25mm, with no inflection, 
which is tangential to the surface and applied perpendicular to the boundary. In no case may 
the arc start further than 25mm from the boundary (when measured on the surface and 
perpendicular to this boundary). 

Where the vertical transition meets the surfaces on the step plane a radius no greater than 
25mm is permitted (a radius in this context will be considered as an arc of constant curvature 
applied perpendicular to the boundary and tangential to both surfaces).  

The surfaces lying on the step plane which do not meet one of the vertical transitions may be 
curved upwards at their boundaries with an arc whose radius of curvature is no greater than 
100mm at any point, with no inflection, which is tangential to the surface and applied 
perpendicular to the boundary. In no case may the arc start further than 100mm from the 
boundary (when measured on the surface and perpendicular to this boundary). 

The surface lying on the reference plane, the surfaces lying on the step plane, the vertical 
transitions between them and any surfaces rearward of the surfaces lying on the reference or 
step planes, must first be fully defined before any radius can be applied or the parts referred 
to in Articles 3.7.10, 3.7.11 and 3.7.12 fitted. Any radius applied is still considered part of the 
relevant surface. 

3.7.4 Floor construction 

All parts lying on the reference and step planes, in addition to the transition between the two 
planes, must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous, rigid (no degree of freedom in relation 
to the unit comprising the survival cell/power unit/gearbox), impervious surfaces under all 
circumstances. 

3.7.5 Tolerances 

To help overcome any possible manufacturing problems, and not to permit any design which 
may contravene any part of these regulations, the following dimensional tolerances are 
permitted on bodywork situated between 430mm behind the front wheel centre line and the 
rear wheel centre line: a vertical tolerance of +/- 3mm is permissible across the surfaces lying 
on the reference and step planes and a horizontal tolerance of 3mm is permitted when 
assessing whether a surface is visible from beneath the car. 

3.7.6 Diffuser width  

The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and less than 200mm above the 
reference plane must not exceed 1050mm. 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 30/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

3.7.7 Diffuser length 

 No part of the car between 100mm and 525mm from the car centre plane and less than 
200mm above the reference plane may be more than 350mm behind the rear wheel centre 
line. 

3.7.8 Diffuser height and construction 

a) No bodywork which is visible from beneath the car and which lies between 175mm 
forward of the rear wheel centre line and 350mm rearward of the rear wheel centre 
line may be more than 175mm above the reference plane. 

Additionally, any bodywork in this area must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous 
(no fully enclosed holes), rigid (no degree of freedom in relation to the unit comprising 
the survival cell/power unit/gearbox), impervious surfaces under all circumstances. 

b)  All sprung parts of the car situated behind a line 175mm in front of the rear wheel 
centre line, which are visible from underneath and are more than 250mm from the car 
centre plane, must be at least 50mm above the reference plane. 

3.7.9 Continuity 

a) In an area lying 450mm or less from the car centre plane, and from 450mm forward of 
the plane C-C to 350mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line, any intersection of any 
bodywork visible from beneath the car with a lateral or longitudinal vertical plane 
should form one continuous line which is visible from beneath the car. 

b) In an area lying 700mm or less from the car centre plane, and from 450mm forward of 
the plane C-C to 350mm forward of the rear wheel centre line, any intersection of any 
bodywork visible from beneath the car with a lateral or longitudinal vertical plane 
should form one continuous line which is visible from beneath the car. 

3.7.10 Plank 

Beneath the surface formed by all parts lying on the reference plane, a rectangular plank, with 
a 50mm radius (+/-2mm) on each front corner, must be fitted. This plank may comprise no 
more than three pieces, the forward one of which may not be any less than 900mm in length, 
but must : 

 a) Extend longitudinally from a point lying 430mm behind the front wheel centre line to 
the rear wheel centre line. 

 b) Have a width of 300mm with a tolerance of +/- 2mm. 

 c) Be made from an homogeneous material with a specific gravity between 1.3 and 1.45, 
or if pocketed be made from a bonded assembly the upper 0.5mm of which must have a 
specific gravity of between 1.3 and 1.65 and the remainder be made from an 
homogeneous material with a specific gravity of between 1.3 and 1.45. 

 d) Have a thickness of 10mm with a tolerance of +/-1mm. 

 e) Have a uniform thickness when new. 

 f) Pocketing of the lower 9.5mm of the plank from above is permitted between 630mm to 
880mm and from 1280mm behind the front wheel centre line, however the pocket 
depth may not reduce the remaining plank material thickness to less than 2mm from 
either the lowest surface below the reference plane when new or the lower surface of 
any recesses necessary to fit the skids permitted by Article 3.7.11. Furthermore, the 
periphery of any pocket, in any horizontal plane parallel to the reference plane, must be 
not less than 10mm from either the edges of the plank or any holes or recesses in the 
plank. In vertical cross section the internal pocket fillet radii must be at least 3mm and 
in horizontal cross section 10mm. Pockets may only be filled with a material having a 
specific gravity of less than 0.25.

  Four further 10mm diameter holes are permitted provided their sole purpose is to allow 
access to the bolts which secure the Accident Data Recorder to the survival cell. 

 i) Be fixed symmetrically about the car centre plane in such a way that no air may pass 
between the complete plank assembly and the surface formed by the parts lying on the 
reference plane. 

 The lower edge of the periphery of the plank may be chamfered at an angle of 30° to a depth 
of 8mm, the trailing edge however may be chamfered over a distance of 200mm to a depth of 
8mm. 

3.7.11 Skids 

The lower surface of the plank may be fitted with flush mounted metal skids which : 

 a) May only be fitted in place of plank material. 

 b) Have a total area no greater than 20000mm² when viewed from directly beneath the 
car. 

 c) Are no greater than 4000mm² in area individually when viewed from directly beneath 
the car.

boundaries of the skid must be no less than 7.5mm. 

 f) Must have an upper surface no more than 3mm below the reference plane. 

 g) Must be designed such that they are secured to the car using the fasteners described in 
Article 3.7.12 and that, when viewed from directly beneath the car, no part of the skid is 
more than 50mm from the centre line of a fastener which passes through that skid. 

 h) Must be made from Titanium alloy. 

3.7.12 Plank and skids mounting 

The plank and skids must be fixed to the car using fasteners which : 

 a) Are no smaller than M6 and are made from grade 12.9 steel. 

 b) If used to attach a skid to the car, must employ at least 1 fastener per 1000mm2 of skid 
area. 

 c) If used to attach a skid to the car, the team must be able to show by calculation that the 
shanks of the fasteners (which may be no less than 6mm diameter) are the weakest 
point in the attachment of the skids to the car. 

 d) May use a load spreading washer if required. 

 The total area of the fasteners and any load spreading washers employed with them when 
viewed from directly beneath the car must be less than 5000mm2. The area of any single 
fastener plus its load spreading washer may not exceed 500mm².

3.8 Aerodynamic influence 

 With the exception of the ducts described in Article 11.4, any specific part of the car 
influencing its aerodynamic performance: 

 a) Must comply with the rules relating to bodywork. 

 b) Must be rigidly secured to the entirely sprung part of the car (rigidly secured means not 
having any degree of freedom). 

 With the exception of the driver adjustable bodywork described in Article 3.6.8 (in addition to 
minimal parts solely associated with its actuation) and the ducts described in Article 11.4, any

3.9 Bodywork flexibility 

3.9.1 Bodywork may deflect no more than 15mm vertically when a 1000N load is applied vertically 
to it at points 675mm and 975mm forward of the front wheel centre line and 795mm from 
the car centre plane. The load will be applied in a downward direction using a 50mm diameter 
ram on a rectangular adapter measuring 400mm x 150mm. This adapter must be supplied by 
the team and : 

 a) Have a flat top surface without recesses. 

 b) Be fitted to the car so as to apply the full load to the bodywork at the test point and not 
to increase the rigidity of the parts being tested. 

 c) Be placed with the inner 400mm edge parallel to the car centre plane and displaced 
from it by 720mm. 

 d) Be placed with its forward edge 1025mm forward of the front wheel centre line. 

 The deflection will be measured along the loading axis at the bottom of the bodywork at this 
point and relative to the reference plane. 

3.9.2 Bodywork may deflect no more than 10mm vertically when a 500N load is applied vertically to 
it 450mm forward of the rear wheel centre line and 650mm from the car centre plane. The 
load will be applied in a downward direction using a 50mm diameter ram and an adapter of 
the same size. Teams must supply the latter when such a test is deemed necessary. 

3.9.3 Bodywork may deflect by no more than one degree horizontally when a load of 1000N is 
applied simultaneously to its extremities in a rearward direction 775mm above the reference 
plane and 20mm forward of the forward edge of the rear wing endplate at 775mm above the 
reference plane. 

3.9.4 Bodywork may deflect no more than 2mm vertically when a 500N load is applied 
simultaneously to each side of it 250mm behind the rear wheel centre line, 325mm from the 
car centre plane and 820mm above the reference plane. The deflection will be measured at 
the outer extremities of the bodywork at a point 395mm behind the rear wheel centre line. 

 The load will be applied in a downward direction through pads measuring 200mm x 100mm 
which conform to the shape of the bodywork beneath them, and with their uppermost 
horizontal surface 820mm above the reference plane. The load will be applied to the centre of 
area of the pads. Teams must supply the latter when such a test is deemed necessary. 

3.9.5 Bodywork may deflect no more than 5mm vertically when a 4000N load is applied vertically to 
it at three different points which lie on the car centre plane and 100mm either side of it. Each 
of these loads will be applied in an upward direction at a point 480mm rearward of the front 
wheel centre line using a 50mm diameter ram in the two outer locations and a 70mm 
diameter ram on the car centre plane. 

 Stays or structures between the front of the bodywork lying on the reference plane and the 
survival cell may be present for this test, provided they are completely rigid and have no 
system or mechanism which allows non-linear deflection during any part of the test. 

 Furthermore, the bodywork being tested in this area may not include any component which is 
capable of allowing more than the permitted amount of deflection under the test load 
(including any linear deflection above the test load), such components could include, but are 
not limited to : 

 a) Joints, bearings pivots or any other form of articulation. 

 b) Dampers, hydraulics or any form of time dependent component or structure. 

 c) Buckling members or any component or design which may have any non-linear 
characteristics. 

 d) Any parts which may systematically or routinely exhibit permanent deformation.

than 5mm horizontally when a 500N load is applied horizontally. The load will be applied 
800mm above the reference plane at three separate points which lie on the car centre plane 
and 240mm either side of it. The loads will be applied in a rearward direction using a suitable 
25mm wide adapter which must be supplied by the relevant team. 

3.9.7 The forward-most aerofoil element lying behind the rear wheel centre line and which lies 
more than 580mm above the reference plane may deflect no more than 2mm vertically when 
a 200N load is applied vertically. The load will be applied in line with the trailing edge of the 
element at any point across its width. 

 The loads will be applied using a suitable adapter, supplied by the relevant team, which : 

 a) May be no more than 50mm wide. 

 b) Which extends no more than 10mm forward of the trailing edge. 

 c) Incorporates an 8mm female thread in the underside. 

3.9.8 Any part of the trailing edge of any front wing flap may deflect no more than 5mm, when 
measured along the loading axis, when a 60N point load is applied normal to the flap. 

3.9.9 In order to ensure that the requirements of Article 3.8 are respected, the FIA reserves the 
right to introduce further load/deflection tests on any part of the bodywork which appears to 
be (or is suspected of), moving whilst the car is in motion. 

3.10 Bodywork construction 

3.10.1 In order to avoid the spread of debris on the track following an accident, the outer skins of the 
front wing endplates and any turning vanes in the vicinity of the front wheels (and any 
similarly vulnerable bodywork parts in this area), must be made predominantly from materials 
which are included for the specific purpose of containing debris. 

 The FIA must be satisfied that all such parts are constructed in order to achieve the stated 
objective.

ARTICLE 9 : TRANSMISSION SYSTEM 

9.1 Transmission types : 

 No transmission system may permit more than two wheels to be driven. 

9.2 Clutch control : 

 The following applies only to the main drivetrain clutch or clutches, any clutch used exclusively 
as part of an ERS is exempt. 

9.2.1 If multiple clutch operating devices are used, they must all have the same mechanical travel 
characteristics and be mapped identically. 

9.2.2 Designs which allow specific points along the travel range of the clutch operating device to be 
identified by the driver or assist him to hold a position are not permitted. 

9.2.3 The minimum and maximum travel positions of the clutch operating device must correspond 
to the clutch fully engaged normal rest position and fully disengaged (incapable of 
transmitting any useable torque) positions respectively. 

9.2.4 Designs or systems which in addition to typical inherent hydraulic and mechanical properties 
are designed to, or have the effect of, adjusting or otherwise influencing the amount, or rate, 
of engagement being demanded by the FIA ECU, are not permitted. 

9.2.5 The amount by which the clutch is engaged must be controlled solely and directly by the 
driver with the exception of : 

 a) Stall prevention. 

 b) Gearshifts. 

 c) Bite point finder where brake pressure, wheel speed and driver clutch demand 
safeguards are used. 

 d) De-clutch protections. 

 e) Drivetrain protection on the track outside of any start lockout period or immediately 
following stall prevention activation only. 

 f) Test signals enabled only when the car is connected to the garage system. 

 The relationship between the clutch operating device in the cockpit and the amount of 
clutch engagement may be non-linear but must remain fixed. 

9.2.6 When the clutch operating device is released from its maximum travel position it must return 
to its resting position within 50ms. 

 The maximum delay allowed, computed from the respective signals as recorded by the ADR or 
ECU, between the clutch driver control input signal and the corresponding output demand 
being achieved is 50ms. 

9.2.7 Any device or system which notifies the driver of the amount of clutch slip or engagement is 
not permitted. 

9.3 Traction control : 

 No car may be equipped with a system or device which is capable of preventing the driven 
wheels from spinning under power or of compensating for excessive torque demand by the 
driver. 

 Any device or system which notifies the driver of the onset of wheel spin is not permitted.

9.4 Clutch disengagement: 

 All cars must be fitted with a means of disengaging the clutch for a minimum of fifteen 
minutes in the event of the car coming to rest with the engine stopped. This system must be in 
working order throughout the Event even if the main hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical 
systems on the car have failed. This system must also disconnect any ERS system fitted to the 
car. 

 In order that the driver or a marshal may activate the system in less than five seconds, the 
switch or button which operates it must : 

 a) Face upwards and be recessed into the top of the survival cell no more than 150mm 
from the car centre plane. 

 b) Be designed in order that a marshal is unable to accidentally re-engage the clutch. 

 c) Be no more than 1150mm forward of the plane C-C.

4mm, inside a white circle of at least 50mm diameter with a red edge with a line 
thickness of at least 2mm. 

9.5 Gearboxes : 

9.5.1 A gearbox is defined as all the parts in the drive line which transfer torque from the power unit 
output shaft, as described in Article 5.3.2, to the drive shafts (the drive shafts being defined as 
those components which transfer drive torque from the sprung mass to the un-sprung mass). 
It includes all components whose primary purpose is for the transmission of power or 
mechanical selection of gears, bearings associated with these components and the casing in 
which they are housed. 

9.5.2 In this context the following parts are not considered part of the gearbox and may be changed 
without incurring a penalty under the F1 Sporting Regulations. If changing any of these parts 
involves breaking an FIA applied seal this may be done but must be carried out under FIA 
supervision : 

 a) The clutch assembly and the power unit output shaft, provided this is located prior to 
any mechanical speed reduction from the engine. 

 b) The clutch actuator and clutch release bearing(s). 

 c) Inboard driveshaft joints and seals but not their housing if that housing is integral with 
the gearbox output shaft and therefore part of the sprung mass. 

 d) The hydraulic system prior to the point at which it produces direct mechanical 
movement of the gear selection mechanism by means of hydraulic actuator(s). 

 e) Oil, oil pumps, oil filters, oil seals, oil coolers and any associated hoses or pipes. 

 f) Electrical sensors, actuators, servo valves and wiring. 

 g) Any parts associated with the suspension or functioning of the sprung suspension that 
are attached to the gearbox casing. 

 h) The rear impact structure provided it can be separated from any gearbox casing. 

 i) Any other component mounted to the casing whose primary purpose is unconnected 
with the transmission of power or selection of gears. 

9.6 Gear ratios : 

9.6.1 The number of forward gear ratios must be 8. 

9.6.2 Each competitor must nominate the forward gear ratios (calculated from engine crankshaft to 
drive shafts) to be employed within their gearbox. These nominations must be declared to the 
FIA technical delegate at or before the first Event of the Championship.  



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 56/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

9.6.3 No forward gear ratio pair may be : 

 a) Less than 12mm wide when measured across the gear tooth at the root diameter or any 
point 1mm above or below the root diameter. Above this area each side of the gear 
teeth may be chamfered by a maximum of 10˚. In addition, a chamfer or radius not 
exceeding 2.0mm may be applied to the sides and the tip of the teeth. 

 b) Less than 85mm between centres. 

 c) Less than 600g in weight (excluding any integral shaft or collar). If an integral shaft or 
collar is to be excluded the mass of this may be shown by calculation assuming the gear 
to be 12mm wide and the shaft geometry to be the same as that where slide on gears 
are used. 

9.6.4 Gear ratios must be made from steel. 

9.6.5 Continuously variable transmission systems are not permitted to transmit the power of the 
power unit defined in Article 5.1. 

9.7 Reverse gear : 

 All cars must be able to be driven in reverse by the driver at any time during the Event. 

9.8 Gear changing : 

9.8.1 Automatic gear changes are considered a driver aid and are therefore not permitted. 

 For the purposes of gear changing, the clutch and power unit torque need not be under the 
control of the driver. 

9.8.2 Gear changing is restricted during the following periods : 

 One gear change is permitted after the race has started and before the car speed has reached 
80km/h, provided every gear fitted to the car is capable of achieving at least 80km/h at 
15,000rpm. 

9.8.3 The minimum possible gear the driver is able to select must remain fixed whilst the car is 
moving. 

 Each individual gear change must be separately initiated by the driver and, within the 
mechanical constraints of the gearbox; the requested gear must be engaged immediately 
unless over-rev protection is used to reject the gear shift request. Once a gear change request 
has been accepted no further requests may be accepted until the first gear change has been 
completed. 

 Multiple gear changes may only be made under Article 5.22 or when a shift to gearbox neutral 
is made following a request from the driver. 

 If an over-rev protection strategy is used this may only prevent engagement of the target gear, 
it must not induce a delay greater than 50ms. If a gear change is refused in this way, 
engagement may only follow a new and separate request made by the driver. 

 Any de-bounce time used to condition driver gear change requests must be fixed. 

9.8.4 The maximum permitted duration for down changes and up changes is 300ms and 200ms 
respectively. The maximum permitted delay for the latter is 80ms from the time of the driver 
request to the original gear being disengaged. 

 The duration of a gear change is defined as the time from the request being made to the point 
at which all gear change processes are terminated. If for any reason the gear change cannot 
be completed in that time the car must be left in neutral or the original gear. 

9.8.5 Distance channel or track position is not considered an acceptable input to gearbox control.

results only from changes in load applied to the rear wheels. 

10.2 Suspension geometry : 

10.2.1 With the steering wheel fixed, the position of each wheel centre and the orientation of its 
rotation axis must be completely and uniquely defined by a function of its principally 
vertical suspension travel, save only for the effects of reasonable compliance which does 
not intentionally provide further degrees of freedom. 

10.2.2 Any powered device which is capable of altering the configuration or affecting the 
performance of any part of any suspension system is forbidden. 

10.2.3 No adjustment may be made to any suspension system while the car is in motion.

bearings, the cross-sections of each member of every suspension component, when taken 
normal to a straight line between the inner and outer attachment points, must : 

 a) Intersect the straight line between the inner and outer attachment points, with the 
exception of front suspension elements for the sole purpose of ensuring minimum 
clearance with the wheel rim at full steering lock. 

 b) Have a major axis no greater than 100mm. 

 c) Have an aspect ratio no greater than 3.5:1. 

 d) Have no dimension which exceeds 100mm.

length of the intersection of this axis with the cross-section must not be less than 95% of the 
maximum dimension of the section. 

10.3.2 Suspension members having shared attachment points will be considered by a virtual 
dissection into discrete members. 

10.3.3 No major axis of a cross section of a suspension member, taken normal to a straight line

10.3.6 In order to help prevent a wheel becoming separated in the event of all suspension members 
connecting it to the car failing, flexible tethers each with a cross sectional area greater than 
110mm² must be fitted. The sole purpose of the tethers is to prevent a wheel becoming 
separated from the car, they should perform no other function. 

 Each wheel must be fitted with three tethers each of which comply with FIA standard 8864-
2013 and each of which has a minimum energy absorption of 7kJ. No suspension member may 
contain more than two tethers.

the axis of the wheel and 100mm measured between the centres of the two 
attachment points. 

 Each tether must exceed 450mm in length and must utilise end fittings which result in a tether 
bend radius greater than 7.5mm. 

Each team must supply detailed geometries which clearly show that any two of the three 
tethers will independently prevent a wheel from making contact with a driver’s head during an 
accident, assuming 7kJ energy absorption in each tether. 

10.4 Steering : 

10.4.1 Any steering system which permits the re-alignment of more than two wheels is not 
permitted. 

10.4.2 Power assisted steering systems may not be electronically controlled or electrically powered. 
No such system may carry out any function other than reduce the physical effort required to 
steer the car. 

10.4.3 No part of the steering wheel or column, nor any part fitted to them, may be closer to the 
driver than a plane formed by the entire rear edge of the steering wheel rim. All parts fixed to 
the steering wheel must be fitted in such a way as to minimise the risk of injury in the event of 
a driver’s head making contact with any part of the wheel assembly. 

10.4.4 The steering wheel, steering column and steering rack assembly must pass an impact test, 
details of the test procedure may be found in Article 16.5.

13.1.1 In order to ensure that the opening giving access to the cockpit is of adequate size, the 
template shown in Drawing 2 will be inserted into the survival cell and bodywork. 

 During this test the secondary roll structure, steering wheel, steering column, seat and all 
padding required by Articles 14.6.1-6 (including fixings), may be removed and the template 
must be held horizontal so its lower face is parallel to the reference plane and lowered 
vertically from above the car until its lower face is 525mm above the reference plane. 

13.1.2 The forward extremity of the cockpit opening, even if structural and part of the survival cell, 
must be at least 50mm in front of the steering wheel. 

13.1.3 The driver must be able to enter and get out of the cockpit without it being necessary to open 
a door or remove any part of the car other than the steering wheel. When seated normally, 
the driver must be facing forwards and the rearmost part of his crash helmet may be no more 
than 125mm forward of the plane C-C. 

13.1.4 From his normal seating position, with all seat belts fastened and whilst wearing his usual 
driving equipment, the driver must be able to remove the steering wheel and get out of the 
car within 7 seconds and then replace the steering wheel in a total of 12 seconds.

© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

14.6.2 The first area of padding for the driver’s head must be positioned behind him and be between 
75mm and 90mm thick over an area of at least 40000mm². If necessary, and only for driver 
comfort, an additional piece of padding no greater than 10mm thick may be attached to this 
headrest provided it is made from the same material. 

14.6.3 Whilst he is seated normally the two further areas of padding for the driver’s head must be 
positioned in an area bounded by two vertical lines and one horizontal line through the front, 
rear and lower extremities of the driver’s helmet (on the car centre plane), and the upper 
surface of the survival cell. 

 Each of these must cover an area greater than 35750mm² when viewed from the side of the 
car and be no less than 95mm thick, this minimum thickness being maintained to the upper 
edges of the survival cell and over their entire length. The minimum thickness will be assessed 
perpendicular to the car centre plane but a radius no greater than 10mm may be applied 
along their upper inboard edges. 

 Furthermore, any void between these areas of padding and the area described in Article 
14.6.2 must also be completely filled with the same material. 

 If necessary, and only for driver comfort, an additional piece of padding no greater than 20mm 
thick may be attached to these headrests provided they are made from the same material 
which incorporates a low friction surface. 

14.6.4 Forward of the side areas of padding further cockpit padding must be provided on each side of 
the cockpit rim. The purpose of the additional padding is to afford protection to the driver's 
head in the event of an oblique frontal impact and must therefore be made from the same

entire length. 

 c) Have a radius on their upper inboard edge no greater than 10mm. 

 d) Be positioned in order that the distance between the two is no less than 320mm. 

 e) Be as high as practicable within the constraints of driver comfort. 

14.6.5 All of the padding described above must be so installed that if movement of the driver's head, 
in any expected trajectory during an accident, were to compress the foam fully at any point, 
his helmet would not make contact with any structural part of the car. 

14.6.6 No part of the padding described above may obscure sight of any part of the driver's helmet 
when he is seated normally and viewed from directly above the car. 

14.6.7 In order to minimise the risk of leg injury during an accident, additional areas of padding must 
be fitted each side of, and above, the driver’s legs. 

These areas of padding must: 

 a) Be made from a material described in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

 b) Be no less than 25mm thick over their entire area. 

 c) Cover the area situated between the plane B-B and 100mm behind the face of the 
rearmost pedal when in the inoperative position, as shown in Drawing 4. 

 d) Cover the area above the plane A-A shown in Drawing 3.

14.7.1 All cars, whilst under their own power, must be fitted with dual stage devices which will retain 
the wheel fastener in the event of it coming loose from both its full fitted position and from 
any angular position before the fastener begins to engage on the axle thread. 

14.7.2 Each team must provide test results which demonstrate that all dual stage devices must be 
able to : 

a) Withstand 15kN of axial tensile force exerted on the wheel nut in a direction away from 
the car centre line whilst the wheel nut is fully disengaged from the thread. 

b) Withstand 250Nm of torque exerted on the wheel nut in the unwinding direction whilst 
the wheel nut is partially engaged on the thread. 

14.7.3 Furthermore, the dual stage retaining systems must incorporate a means of allowing the 
wheel operator/fitter to visually identify an incorrectly fitted fastener. 

14.8 Seat fixing and removal : 

14.8.1 In order that an injured driver may be removed from the car in his seat following an accident, 
all cars must be fitted with a seat which, if it is secured, must be done so with no more than 
two bolts. If bolts are used they must be : 

 a) Clearly indicated and easily accessible to rescue crews. 

 b) Fitted vertically. 

 c) Removable with the same tool for all teams and which is issued to all rescue crews. 

14.8.2 The seat must be equipped with receptacles which permit the fitting of belts to secure the 
driver and one which will permit the fitting of a head stabilisation device. 

14.8.3 The seat must be removable without the need to cut or remove any of the seat belts. 

14.8.4 Details of the tool referred to above, the belt receptacles and the head stabilisation device 
may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

14.9 Head and neck supports : 

 No head and neck support worn by the driver may be less than 25mm from any structural part 
of the car when he is seated in his normal driving position.

15.4.3 Referring to Drawing 5: 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 72/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

The rear face of the cockpit entry template, whilst held in the position described in Article 
13.1.1, defines the position of the plane C-C. 

The car centre plane is the plane of symmetry of the cockpit entry template, whilst held in the 
position described in Article 13.1.1, perpendicular to the reference plane and to C-C. 

The plane B-B is parallel to and lies 875mm forward of C-C. 

The plane A-A is parallel to and lies no less than 1800mm forward of C-C. 
 The survival cell front bulkhead must be on or forward of the plane A-A. 

The external width of the survival cell between the planes B-B and C-C must be no less than 
450mm and must be at least 60mm per side wider than the cockpit opening when measured 
normal to the inside of the cockpit aperture. These minimum dimensions must be maintained 
over a height of at least 350mm. 

Between the planes A-A and B-B, any external cross-section of the survival cell by a plane 
parallel to C-C must contain a rectangle with radii applied on its four corners, positioned 
symmetrically about the car centre plane, of the following dimensions : 

a) Width defined by a linear interpolation from 450mm at the plane B-B to 300mm at the 
plane A-A. 

b) Height defined by a linear interpolation from 400mm at the plane B-B to 275mm at the 
plane A-A. 

c) Corner radii defined by a linear interpolation from 50mm at the plane B-B to 25mm at 
the plane A-A. 

 No part of the survival cell, nor any part rigidly attached to it (with the exception of the panel 
of prescribed laminate referred to in Article 3.4.2, pitot tubes and antennae), which lies 
between the plane A-A and a parallel plane 375mm behind of A-A, may lie above a diagonal 
plane defined by a line on A-A, parallel to and 525mm above the reference plane and a parallel 
line, 375mm rearward of A-A and 625mm above the reference plane. 

The maximum height of the survival cell between the planes A-A and B-B is 625mm above the 
reference plane. 

15.4.4 When the test referred to in Article 13.1.1 is carried out and the template is in position with its 
lower face parallel to and 525mm above the reference plane, the shape of the survival cell 
must be such that no part of it is visible when viewed from either side of the car. The parts of 
the survival cell which are situated each side of the driver's head must be no more than 
550mm apart. 

 In order to ensure that the driver’s head is not unduly exposed and for him to maintain good 
lateral visibility he must, when seated normally and looking straight ahead with his head as far 
back as possible, have his eye visible when viewed from the side. The centre of gravity of his 
head must lie below the top of the survival cell at this position. When viewed from the side of 
the car, the centre of gravity of the driver’s head will be deemed to be the intersection of a 
vertical line passing through the centre of his ear and a horizontal line passing through the 
centre of his eye. 

15.4.5 In order to give additional protection to the driver in the event of a side impact a flat test 
panel of uniform construction, which is designed and constructed in order to represent a 
section of the survival cell sides, must pass a strength test. Details of the test procedure may 
be found in Article 18.7. 

 Referring to Drawing 5, with the exception of local reinforcement and/or inserts, all parts of 
the survival cell which are as wide or wider than the minimum widths stipulated in Article 
15.4.3, including any radii applied, must be manufactured to the same specification as a single 
panel which satisfies the requirements of Article 18.7. However, additional plies may be used 
and core thickness may be increased where applicable, and local relief applied, provided the 
FIA technical delegate is satisfied in each case that the overall strength of the structure has 
been improved by doing so.

panels no less than 6.2mm thick, constructed from 16 plies of Zylon and two plies of carbon 
(precise lay-up instructions may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations) must 
then be permanently attached to each side of the survival cell with an appropriate adhesive 
which has been applied over their entire surface. 

 These panels must, in side view, cover the area lying between B-B, two planes parallel to and 
100mm and 550mm above the reference plane and two lines parallel to and 50mm (measured 
normal to the lines) behind the lines a-b and b-c (referring to Drawing 2). Furthermore, when 
viewed from the side, the panel must cover the cockpit entry template shown in side view in 
Drawing 2.  

 A 50mm linear taper may be included at the forward and rearward boundaries of the panel, 
and a 20mm linear taper may be included at the upper boundary of the panel behind a vertical 
plane parallel to and 375mm forward of C-C (measured normal to the boundaries). 

 Cut-outs in these panels totalling 35000mm² per side will be permitted for fitting around side 
impact structures, the survival cell openings described in article 15.4.2c) and essential fixings. 

15.4.7 Once the requirements of Articles 15.4.4, 15.4.6, 15.5.1, 15.5.2, 15.5.4, 15.5.5, 16.1, 16.2, 
16.3, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5, 18.6, 18.7 and 18.9 have been met one 
further panel, which may be made in a maximum of three parts but which is no less than 
3.0mm thick, constructed from seven plies of Zylon and two plies of carbon (precise lay-up 
instructions may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations), must then be 
permanently attached to the survival cell with an appropriate adhesive which has been 
applied over its entire surface including all overlapping joints. 

 This panel must, in side view, cover the area of the outer skin of the survival cell lying between 
a plane parallel to and 300mm rearward of A-A, a plane parallel to and 650mm forward of C-C 
and two planes parallel to and 60mm and 550mm above the reference plane. This will not 
apply at the top of this panel where any radius permitted by Article 15.4.3 falls inside the 
minimum permitted survival cell width nor for the area fitted with the panel defined by Article 
15.4.6. 

A 25mm horizontal linear taper may be included at the forward and rearward boundaries of 
the panel. 

This panel must overlap the panel defined by Article 15.4.6 along all joining edges by a 
minimum of 25mm. If made in more than one part, all adjacent panels must overlap by a 
minimum of 25mm. All overlaps may include linear tapers in the thickness of both overlapping 
parts. 

Cut-outs in this panel totalling 15000mm² per side will be permitted for fitting around the 
survival cell openings described in article 15.4.2c) and essential fixings. 

15.5 Survival cell safety requirements :

© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

15.5.2 Between the principal and secondary roll structures, two impact absorbing structures must be 
fitted on each side of the survival cell and must be solidly attached to it. The purpose of these 
structures is to protect the driver in the event of a lateral impact and, in order to ensure this is 
the case, strength tests of the mountings must be carried out successfully. Details of the test 
procedure may be found in Articles 18.9 and 18.10. 

 The impact absorbing structures must be manufactured and mounted to the survival cell in 
accordance with the following specifications : 

 a) The construction and geometry of the structures may be found in the Appendix to the 
Technical Regulations. 

 b) The structures must be mounted with the principal axes of their prismatic mounting 
sections perpendicular to the longitudinal and vertical centre plane of the car, and with 
the centres of area of their outermost longitudinal vertical cross sections positioned : 

 i) Longitudinally : 500mm (+/-25mm) forward of the plane C-C and within 1mm of 
each other. 

 ii) Vertically : Between 400mm and 520mm above the reference plane and between 
70mm and 190mm above the reference plane for the upper and lower structures 
respectively. 

 iii) Laterally : Within 1mm of each other. 

 Refer to the drawings which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

 c) Mountings must be permanently bonded to the structures to enable them to be 
attached to the survival cell, each of them must : 

 i) Incorporate a closed end and internal abutment to the impact structure that 
must be capable of withstanding the lateral load described in Article18.10 
without a structural contribution from the bonded interface. 

 ii) Lie entirely inboard of a plane which lies 292mm inboard of the outermost 
longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure. 

 iii) Be arranged in order that the outermost surface created by an interface 
between the mounting and structure lies on a vertical surface that is located 
within the zone indicated in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

 iv) Be arranged in order that the innermost extent of the bonded interface 
between the mounting and structure is offset inboard by a minimum of 44mm 
from the vertical surface defined in (iii) above. 

 v) Be arranged in order that the bonded interface covers the entire external area 
of the structure between the innermost and outermost extents defined in iii) 
and iv) above. 

 d) To allow for debris compaction, the internal volume of the : 

 i) Upper structure must be empty outboard of a vertical plane intersecting the 
structure leading edge at 367mm and trailing edge at 342mm measured from the 
outermost longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure as indicated 
in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

 ii) Lower structure must be empty outboard of a vertical plane intersecting the 
structure leading edge at 382mm and trailing edge at 357mm measured from the 
outermost longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure as indicated 
in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

 No parts which, in the opinion of the FIA technical delegate, would prevent proper function of 
the impact structures in the event of a lateral impact may be present in the volume lying 
between 300mm and 700mm forward of the plane C-C, and between 50mm and 600mm 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 75/105 19 December 2017

above the reference plane, and outboard of a plane 280mm inboard of the outermost 
longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structures. 

15.5.3 An impact absorbing structure must be fitted behind the gearbox symmetrically about the car 
centre plane with the centre of area of its rearmost face 300mm (+/-5mm) above the 
reference plane and no less than 575mm behind the rear wheel centre line. 

 The rearmost face of the impact structure must be a rectangular section no less than 100mm 
wide, this minimum width must be maintained over a height of at least 130mm and each 
corner may incorporate a radius no greater than 10mm. 

 Furthermore, when viewed from the side, the lowest and highest points of the impact 
absorbing structure between its rear face and 50mm aft of the rear wheel centre line may not 
be separated vertically by more than 275 mm. 

 Between the rear face and the rear wheel centre line no dimension of the area thus defined 
may diminish nor may any part of the structure or gearbox which is visible from below, other 
than the permitted radii, be higher than the lower edge of the rear face. Pockets of minimum 
size within the structure are permitted for the sole purpose of attaching suspension members. 

 This structure must pass an impact test and must be constructed from materials which will not 
be substantially affected by the temperatures it is likely to be subjected to during use. Details 
of the test procedure may be found in Article 16.4. 

 In order to minimise the likelihood of the structure penetrating a survival cell, it must be 
designed so that the majority of its material lies evenly around its perimeter. Therefore, the 
perimeter of every vertical cross section between points 50mm forward of its rear face and 
200mm forward of its rear face must be of a uniform construction and, with the exception of 
minimal local changes for attachments, have a minimum thickness of 1.75mm. Material with a 
specific gravity of less than 1 will not be considered when calculating these thicknesses and, 
furthermore, any internal structure must not be thicker than any part of the perimeter at that 
section. 

 Only those parts of the structure which genuinely contribute to its performance during the 
impact test, and which are designed and fitted for that sole purpose, will be considered when 
assessing compliance with any of the above. 

15.5.4 The survival cell must also be subjected to five separate static load tests : 

 1) On a vertical plane passing through the centre of the fuel tank. 

 2) On a vertical plane passing through the rearmost point at which the outer end of the 
forward-most front wheel tether would make contact with the survival cell when swung 
about the inner attachment. 

 3) From beneath the fuel tank. 

 4) On each side of the cockpit opening. 

 5) From beneath the cockpit floor. 

 Details of the test procedures may be found in Article 18.2, 18.3, 18.4 and 18.5. 

15.5.5 To test the attachments of the frontal, side and rear impact absorbing structures static side 
load tests must be carried out. Details of these test procedures may be found in Articles 18.6, 
18.8 and 18.9.2. 

 
15.5.6 An impact absorbing structure must be fitted in front of the survival cell. This structure need 

not be an integral part of the survival cell but must be solidly attached to it and be arranged 
symmetrically about the car centre plane. 

 No part of this structure may lie more than 525mm above the reference plane and its forward-
most point must not be less than 1050mm forward of the front wheel centre line. 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 76/105 19 December 2017

The plane D-D is defined as a plane parallel to the plane C-C and 50mm rearward of the 
forward-most point of this impact absorbing structure. 

The plane E-E is defined as a plane parallel to the plane C-C and 150mm rearward of the 
forward-most point of this impact absorbing structure. 

This structure must have: 

a) A single external vertical cross-section which area exceeds 9000mm² at the plane D-D. 
No part of this cross-section may lie less than 135mm above the reference plane and its 
overall width must not exceed 140mm. 

 

 b) A single external vertical cross-section which area exceeds 20000mm² at the plane E-E. 
The overall width of this cross-section must not exceed 330mm. 

 When measuring these sections, only parts between the highest point of the section and 
100mm vertically below this point, may be considered. 

 Each external vertical cross-section, taken on planes parallel to the plane C-C between the 
plane E-E and 150mm forward of the front wheel centre line, must be a single section with an 
area which exceeds a value given by a linear taper from 20000mm² to 60000mm² respectively. 

 Furthermore, all lines drawn normally and externally to a cross-section taken on a plane 
parallel to C-C and 150mm forward of the front wheel centre line must not cross the car 
centre plane.

ARTICLE 16 : IMPACT TESTING 

16.1 Conditions applicable to all impact tests : 

16.1.1 All tests must be carried out in accordance with FIA Test Procedure 01/00, in the presence of 
an FIA technical delegate and by using measuring equipment which has been calibrated to the 
satisfaction of the FIA technical delegate. A copy of the test procedure may be found in the 
Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

16.1.2 Any significant modification introduced into any of the structures tested shall require that part 
to pass a further test. 

16.2 Frontal test 1 : 

 To simulate in-car conditions, all parts which could materially affect the outcome of the test 
must be fitted to the test structure which must be solidly fixed to the trolley through the 
mounting points of the nose structure, but not in such a way as to increase its impact 
resistance. 

 If the test facility includes a system to manage excess residual energy (in the event that the 
nose structure fails to absorb all the test energy), such a system must not in any way modify 
the results during a successful test. 

 For the purposes of this test, the total weight of the trolley and test structure shall be 
780kg (+1%/-0) and the velocity of impact not less than 15 metres/second. 

 The resistance of the test structure must be such that during the impact either : 

 a) The peak deceleration over the first 100mm of deformation does not 
exceed 10g. 

 b) The peak permissible deceleration increases linearly from 10g at 100mm to 
20g at 150mm of deformation. 

 c) The peak deceleration over the first 60kJ energy absorption does not 
exceed 20g. 

 d) The average deceleration over the first 150mm of deformation exceeds 2.5g. 

 e) The peak deceleration of the trolley does not exceed 45g. 

 Or : 

 a) The peak force over the first 100mm of deformation does not exceed 75kN. 

 b) The peak permissible force increases linearly from 75kN at 100mm to 150kN 
at 150mm of deformation. 

 c) The peak force over the first 60kJ energy absorption does not 
exceed 150kN. 

 d) The average force over the first 150mm of deformation exceeds 18.75kN. 

 e) The peak force does not exceed 337.5kN. 

 Furthermore, there must be no damage to the mountings of the nose. 

 This test must be carried out on the frontal impact absorbing structure which was subjected to 
the first test described in Article 18.6. 

16.3 Frontal test 2: 

 A 50mm (+/-1mm) thick aluminium plate should be attached to the front bulkhead of 
the survival cell through the mounting points of the frontal impact absorbing structure. 
The plate should : 

a) Measure 500mm (+/-1mm) wide x 375mm (+/-1mm) high. 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 78/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

b) Be fitted symmetrically about the car centre plane. 
c) Be fitted in a vertical sense in order to ensure force distribution is similar 

to that with the nose fitted. 

d) Have six M10 x 30mm holes in the outer face arranged in a 125mm square grid 
pattern, two squares wide and one square high, about its geometric centre. The 
test laboratory will then fit a 5mm thick 500mm x 275mm steel plate to these 
holes using a 5mm washer stack. 

All parts which could materially affect the outcome of the test must be fitted to the test 
structure which must be solidly fixed to the trolley through its engine mounting points 
but not in such a way as to increase its impact resistance. 

The fuel tank must be fitted and must be full of water. 

A dummy weighing at least 75kg must be fitted with safety belts described in Article 14.4 
fastened. However, with the safety belts unfastened, the dummy must be able to move 
forwards freely in the cockpit. The dummy shall be equipped with a helmet to FIA8860 or 
FIA8859 and an FHR to FIA8858 (the weight of the helmet and FHR should be recorded, but 
should not be included in the 75kg). The safety belts shall be fastened to represent in-race 
conditions. 

The fire extinguishers, as described in Article 14.1 must also be fitted. 

For the purposes of this test, the total weight of the trolley and test structure shall be 
between 900kg and 925kg and the velocity of impact not less than 15 metres/second. 

The impact wall must be fitted with six crush tubes which develop a combined 450kN as 
follows: 

 a) 2 x 75kN tubes from T-zero to T-end, directed into the lower left and right M10 
attachment points. 

 b) 2 x 75kN tubes from T-100mm to T-end, directed into the central M10 
attachment points  

 c) 2 x 75kN tubes from T-200mm to T-end, directed into the upper left and right 
M10 attachment points. 

The resistance of the test structure must be such that following the impact there is no 
damage to the survival cell or to the mountings of the safety belts or fire extinguishers. 

The maximum deceleration in the chest of the dummy for a cumulative 3ms shall be reported, 
this being the resultant of data from the three orthogonal axes. 

This test may be carried out on any survival cell provided it has been successfully subjected 
to the tests described in Articles 17.2, 17.3 and 18.2-5. The test must however be carried 
out on the survival cell which was subjected to the test described in Article 18.6. 

Specifications of the crush tubes and test arrangement may be found in the Appendix to the 
Technical Regulations. 

16.4 Rear test : 

 All parts which will be fitted behind the rear face of the engine and which could materially 
affect the outcome of the test must be fitted to the test structure. If suspension members are 
to be mounted on the structure they must be fitted for the test. The structure and the 
gearbox must be solidly fixed to the ground and a solid object, having a mass of 780kg (+1%/-
0) and travelling at a velocity of not less than 11 metres/second, will be projected into it. 

 The object used for this test must be flat, measure 450mm (+/-3mm) wide by 550mm (+/-
3mm) high and may have a 10mm radius on all edges. Its lower edge must be at the same 
level as the car reference plane (+/-3mm) and must be so arranged to strike the structure 
vertically and parallel to the plane C-C. 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 79/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

 During the test, the striking object may not pivot in any axis and the crash structure may be 
supported in any way provided this does not increase the impact resistance of the parts being 
tested. 

 The resistance of the test structure must be such that during the impact : 

 a) The peak deceleration over the first 225mm of deformation does not exceed 20g. 

 b) The maximum deceleration does not exceed 20g for more than a cumulative 15ms, this 
being measured only in the direction of impact. 

 Furthermore, all structural damage must be contained within the area behind the rear wheel 
centre line. 

 This test must be carried out on the rear impact absorbing structure which was subjected to 
the test described in Article 18.8. 

16.5 Steering column test : 

 The parts referred to in Article 10.4.4 must be fitted to a representative test structure; any 
other parts which could materially affect the outcome of the test must also be fitted. The test 
structure must be solidly fixed to the ground and a solid object, having a mass of 8kg (+1%/-0) 
and travelling at a velocity of not less than 7metres/second, will be projected into it. 

 The object used for this test must be hemispherical with a diameter of 165mm (+/-1mm). 

 For the test, the centre of the hemisphere must strike the structure at the centre of the 
steering wheel along the same axis as the main part of the steering column. 

 During the test the striking object may not pivot in any axis and the test structure may be 
supported in any way provided this does not increase the impact resistance of the parts being 
tested. 

 The resistance of the test structure must be such that during the impact the peak deceleration 
of the object does not exceed 80g for more than a cumulative 3ms, this being measured only 
in the direction of impact. 

 After the test, all substantial deformation must be within the steering column and the steering 
wheel quick release mechanism must still function normally.

the shape of the survival cell, must be placed against the outermost sides of the survival cell 
with the lower edge of the pad at the lowest part of the survival cell at that section. 

 A constant transverse horizontal load of 25.0kN will be applied and, under the load, there

point 250mm forward of the plane C-C.  

 A constant transverse horizontal load of 50kN will then be applied at 90° to the car centre 
plane and, under the load, there must be no structural failure of the inner or outer surfaces of 
the survival cell. 

 This test must be repeated at positions 50mm and 150mm forward of the plane C-C. 

18.6 Nose push off tests : 

 Noses of identical design must be subjected to two separate tests. 

 Test 1 : 

 During the first test the nose must be mounted to the same fixture that is used for the frontal 
impact test 1. 

 A constant transversal horizontal load of 40.0kN must then be applied to one side of the 
impact absorbing structure, using a pad identical to the ones used in the lateral tests in Article 
18.2.1, at a point 550mm from the front wheel axis. 

 The centre of area of the pad must pass through the plane mentioned above and the mid-

there must be no failure of the structure or of any attachment between the structure and the 
fixture. 

 Test 2 : 

 During the second test the survival cell must be resting on a flat plate and secured to it solidly 
but not in a way that could increase the strength of the attachments being tested. 

 A constant transversal horizontal load of 40.0kN must then be applied to one side of the 
impact absorbing structure, using a pad identical to the ones used in the lateral tests in Article 
18.2.1, at a point 550mm from the front wheel axis. 

 The centre of area of the pad must pass through the plane mentioned above and the mid-
point of the height of the structure at the relevant section. After 30 seconds of application, 
there must be no failure of the structure or of any attachment between the structure and the 
survival cell. 

18.7 Side intrusion test : 

18.7.1 The test must be carried out in accordance with FIA Test Procedure 02/05, in the presence of 
an FIA technical delegate and by using measuring equipment which has been calibrated to the 
satisfaction of the FIA technical delegate. A copy of the test procedure may be found in the 
Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

18.7.2 The test panel must be 500mm x 500mm and will be tested by forcing a rigid truncated cone 
through the centre of the panel at a rate of 2mm (+/-1mm) per second until the displacement 
exceeds 150mm. 

 During the first 100mm of displacement the load must exceed 250kN and the energy 
absorption must exceed 6000J. There must be no systematic damage to the border or damage 
to the fixture before these requirements have been met. 

18.8 Rear impact structure push off test : 

 During the test the gearbox and the structure must be solidly fixed to the ground but not in a 
way that could increase the strength of the attachments being tested. 



  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 83/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

 A constant transversal horizontal load of 40kN must then be applied to one side of the impact 
absorbing structure, using a pad identical to the ones used in the lateral tests in Article 18.2.1, 
at a point 400mm behind the rear wheel axis. 

 The centre of area of the pad must pass through the plane mentioned above and the mid 
point of the height of the structure at the relevant section. After 30 seconds of application, 
there must be no failure of the structure or of any attachment between the structure and the 
gearbox. 

18.9 Side impact structure push off tests : 

18.9.1 Each team must supply detailed calculations which clearly show that the mountings of the 
upper and lower side impact structures are capable of withstanding : 

 a) Horizontal loads of 40kN and 60kN applied simultaneously to the upper and lower 
structures respectively in a rearward direction through ball-jointed pads, which may 
conform to the shape of the structures, measuring 100mm high x 100mm wide and 
whose centre of area lies 100mm inboard of the centre of the outermost longitudinal 
vertical cross-section of the impact structure. 

 b) Horizontal loads of 40kN and 60kN applied simultaneously to the upper and lower 
structures respectively in a forward direction through ball-jointed pads, which may 
conform to the shape of the structures, measuring 100mm high x 100mm wide and 
whose centre of area lies 100mm inboard of the centre of the outermost longitudinal 
vertical cross-section of the impact structure. 

 c) A vertical load of 35kN applied in an upward direction to the lower impact structure 
through a ball-jointed pad, which may conform to the shape of the structure, measuring 
200mm long x 100mm wide whose centre of area lies 100mm inboard of the centre of 
the outermost longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure. 

 d) A vertical load of 27kN applied in a downward direction to the upper impact structure 
through a ball-jointed pad, which may conform to the shape of the structure, measuring 
200mm long x 100mm wide whose centre of area lies 100mm inboard of the centre of 
the outermost longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure. 

 In all cases the calculations should show that there will be no structural failure of the parts. It 
should be assumed that ball-jointed pads are used, the joint lying at the centre of area of the 
pad. 

18.9.2 These tests may be carried out on any survival cell provided it has been successfully subjected 
to the tests described in Articles 17.2, 17.3 and 18.2-5. The tests may be performed on either 
side of the survival cell. 

 During the push off tests the survival cell must be resting on a flat plate and secured to it 
solidly but not in a way that could increase the strength of the attachments being tested. 

 Temporary spacers representing part sections of the panels described in Article 15.4.6 may be 
incorporated within the assembly of the impact structures to the survival cell. These spacers 
may not in any way increase the strength of the survival cell being tested. 

 Dummy test parts may be used in place of the impact structure provided the test part 
incorporates identical mounting details to those described in Article 15.5.2(c) and does not in 
any way increase the strength of the attachments being tested. 

 During the first test rearward horizontal loads of 40kN and 60kN applied simultaneously to the 
upper and lower structures respectively through ball joints or ball-jointed pads whose centre 
of area lies 100mm inboard of the centre of the outermost cross-section of the dummy impact 
structures.

 During the second test an upward vertical load of 35kN must then be applied to the lower 
impact absorbing structure using a ball joint or a ball-jointed pad whose centre of area lies 
100mm inboard of the centre of the outermost cross section of the dummy lower impact 
structure. 

 After five seconds of application there must be no failure of any structures or of any 
attachment between the structure and the survival cell. 

18.10 Side impact structure squeeze tests : 

 This test may be carried out on any survival cell which has been subjected to the tests 
described in Articles 17.2, 17.3 and 18.2-5. The test may be performed on either side of the 
survival cell. 

 During the test, the survival cell may be supported in any way provided this does not increase 
the strength of the attachments being tested. 

 Temporary spacers representing part sections of the panels described in Article 15.4.6 may be 
incorporated within the assembly of the impact structures to the survival cell. These spacers 
cannot in any way increase the strength of the survival cell being tested. 

 Dummy test parts may be used in place of the impact structure provided the test parts 
incorporate identical mounting details to those described in Article 15.5.2(c) and do not in any 
way increase the strength of the attachments being tested. 

 Loads of 100kN and 150kN must be applied simultaneously to the dummy upper and lower 
structures respectively in a lateral direction using a hemispherical pad or ball joint, loading 
through the centre cross section, 292mm from the outermost longitudinal vertical cross-
section of both impact structures. 

 After five seconds of application there must be no failure of the survival cell or the 
attachments between the structures and the survival cell.

ARTICLE 19 : FUEL 

19.1 Purpose of Article 19 : 

19.1.1 The purpose of this Article is to ensure that the fuel used in Formula One is petrol as this term 
is generally understood. 

19.1.2 The detailed requirements of this Article are intended to ensure the use of fuels that are 
composed of compounds normally found in commercial fuels and to prohibit the use of 
specific power-boosting chemical compounds. Acceptable compounds and compound classes 
are defined in 19.2 and 19.4.3. In addition, to cover the presence of low level impurities, the 
sum of components lying outside the 19.2 and 19.4.3 definitions are limited to 1% max m/m of 
the total fuel. 

19.1.3 Any petrol, which appears to have been formulated in order to subvert the purpose of this 
regulation, will be deemed to be outside it. 

19.2 Definitions : 

 Paraffins - Straight chain and branched alkanes. 

 Olefins - Straight chain and branched mono-olefins and di-olefins. 

- Monocyclic mono-olefins (with five or more carbon atoms in the ring) with 
or without paraffinic side chains. 

 Di-olefins - Straight chain or branched or monocyclic hydrocarbons (with five or more 
carbon atoms in any ring) with or without paraffinic side chains, containing 
two double bonds per molecule. 

 Naphthenes - Monocyclic alkanes (with five or more carbon atoms in the ring) with or 
without paraffinic side chains. 

 Aromatics - Monocyclic and bicyclic aromatic rings with or without paraffinic side 
chains.  

 Oxygenates - Organic compounds containing oxygen. 

 Biocomponents - Paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, aromatics and oxygenates, as defined above, 
derived in whole or part from biological origins. For the purposes of 
quantification, the biocomponent contribution of a given molecule is 
defined as the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms from biological origin as 
a percent of the total molecule, on a mass/mass basis. The biocomponent 
contribution of a co-produced stream is determined as the bio feedstock 
percentage on a mass/mass basis. 

 Metals  Metals are defined as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, 
actinides, lanthanides, post-transition metals and metalloids.

included in Formula One fuel as part of the 5.75% bio-components quota, provided that a 
suitable analytical procedure is available for their quantification and to verify their biological 
origin. Their use in F1 fuel will be dependent on evidence indicating that the supplier is 
genuinely developing these compounds for use in commercial fuels. 

19.5 Air : 

 Only ambient air may be mixed with the fuel as an oxidant. 

19.6 Safety : 

19.6.1 All competitors must be in possession of a Material Safety Data Sheet for each type of petrol 
used.  This sheet must be made out in accordance with EC Directive 93/112/EEC and all 
information contained therein strictly adhered to. 

19.7 Fuel approval : 

19.7.1 Before any fuel may be used in an Event, two separate five litre samples, in suitable 
containers, must be submitted to the FIA for analysis and approval. 

19.7.2 No fuel may be used in an Event without prior written approval of the FIA. 

19.7.3 No competitor may have more than five fuel formulations approved for use during a

2018 F1 Technical Regulations 87/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

19.8 Sampling and testing at an Event: 

19.8.1 All samples will be taken in accordance with the FIA Formula One fuel sampling procedure, a 
copy of which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 

19.8.2 Fuel density will also be checked and must be within 0.25% of the figure noted during pre-
approval analysis. 

19.8.3 Fuel samples taken during an Event will be checked for conformity by using a gas 
chromatographic technique, which will compare the sample taken with an approved fuel. 
Samples which differ from the approved fuel in a manner consistent with evaporative loss, will 
be considered to conform. However, the FIA retains the right to subject the fuel sample to 
further testing at an FIA approved laboratory. 

19.8.4 GC peak areas of the sample will be compared with those obtained from the reference fuel. 
Increases in any given peak area (relative to its adjacent peak areas) which are greater than 
12%, or an absolute amount greater than 0.10% for compounds present at concentrations 
below 0.8%, will be deemed not to comply. 

 If a peak is detected in a fuel sample that was absent in the corresponding reference fuel, and 
its peak area represents more than 0.10% of the summed peak areas of the fuel, the fuel will 
be deemed not to comply. 

If the deviations observed (above) by GC indicate that they are due to mixing with another 
Formula One fuel, which has been approved by the FIA for use by the team, the fuel sample 
will be deemed to comply, provided that the adulterant fuel is present at no more than 10% in 
the sample.

ARTICLE 20 : ENGINE OIL 

20.1 Purpose of Article 20 : 

20.1.1 The purpose of this Article is to ensure that the engine oil used in Formula One is engine oil as 
this term is generally understood. The function of an engine oil is to lubricate moving parts, to 
improve the overall efficiency of the engine by reducing friction and to reduce wear. It also 
cleans, inhibits corrosion, improves sealing, and cools the engine by carrying heat away from 
moving parts. Engine oils should not enhance the properties of the fuel nor energize the 
combustion. The presence of any component that cannot be rationally associated with the 
defined functions of the engine oil will be deemed unacceptable. 

20.1.2 Any engine oil, which appears to have been formulated in order to subvert the purpose of this 
regulation, will be deemed to be outside it. 

20.2 Definitions : 

 Engine oil Fluid serving the purpose of Article 20.1 and comprising base oils and additives as 
defined below. 

 Base Oil General : 

 a) A base oil is a base stock or blend of base stocks. 

 b) A base stock is a lubricant component that is produced by a single 
manufacturer. Base stocks may be manufactured using a variety of 
different processes including but not limited to distillation, solvent refining, 
hydrogen processing, oligomerization, esterification, and re-refining. 

  Base stock categories : 

  All base stocks are divided into five general categories : 

 a) Group I base stocks contain less than 90 percent saturates and/or greater 
than 0.03 percent sulfur and have a viscosity index greater than or equal to 
80 and less than 120 using the test methods specified in Table 20.1. 

 b) Group II base stocks contain greater than or equal to 90 percent saturates 
and less than or equal to 0.03 percent sulfur and have a viscosity index 
greater than or equal to 80 and less than 120 using the test methods 
specified in Table 20.1. 

 c) Group III base stocks contain greater than or equal to 90 percent saturates 
and less than or equal to 0.03 percent sulfur and have a viscosity index 
greater than or equal to 120 using the test methods specified in Table 20.1. 

 d) Group IV base stocks are polyalphaolefins (PAO). 

 e) Group V base stocks include all other base stocks not included in Group I, II, 
III, or IV.

© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 

 Additives Additives are chemical compounds added to the base oil in small concentrations 
that improve the performance characteristics of the engine oil. 

20.3 Properties : 

 The engine oil must comply with the following characteristics : 

 Property Units Min Max Test Method 

 Kinematic Viscosity (100oC) cSt 2.8  ASTM D445 

 HTHS Viscosity at 150oC 

 and Shear Rate of 106 s-1 mPa.s 1.4  ASTM D4741 

 Initial Boiling Point oC 210  ASTM D7500 

 Flashpoint oC 93  ASTM D3828 

 The oil will be accepted or rejected according to ASTM D 3244 with a confidence limit of 95%. 

20.4 Composition of the engine oil : 

20.4.1 In the event that the initial boiling point test (ASTM D7500) suggests the presence of 
compounds with a boiling point of less than 210°C the sample will be further analysed by 
GCMS. The total of any components with boiling points less than 210°C must not exceed 0.5% 
m/m. 

20.4.2 The engine oil must not contain any organo-metallic petrol additives or other octane boosting 
petrol additives. 

20.5 Safety : 

20.5.1 All competitors must be in possession of a Material Safety Data Sheet for each type of engine 
oil used. This sheet must be made out in accordance with EC Directive 93/112/EEC or US 
equivalent and all information contained therein strictly adhered to. 

20.6 Engine oil approval : 

20.6.1 Before any engine oil may be used in an Event, two separate one-litre samples, in suitable 
containers, must be submitted to the FIA for analysis and approval. 

20.6.2 No engine oil may be used in an Event without prior written approval of the FIA. 

20.7 Sampling and testing at an Event : 

20.7.1 Each competitor must declare, prior to every Event, which oil will be used in each of their 
engines during the Event. 

20.7.2 For reference purposes, before any oil may be used at an Event, a sample must be submitted 
to the FIA together with the oil reference number. 

20.7.3 No competitor may use more than one oil in a given engine during an Event. 

20.7.4 Engine oil samples taken during an Event will be checked for conformity by using a fourier 
transform infrared (FTIR) technique, which will compare the sample taken with that submitted 
at the start of the event. Samples which differ from the reference engine oil in a manner 
consistent with fuel dilution, engine fluids contamination and oil ageing as a result of normal 
engine operation, will be considered to conform. Samples which differ from the reference 
engine oil in a manner consistent with the mixing with other engine oils, which have been 
approved by the FIA for use by the team, will be deemed to comply, provided that the 
adulterant oils are in total present at no more than 10% in the sample. However, the FIA 
retains the right to subject the oil sample to further testing at an FIA approved laboratory.
