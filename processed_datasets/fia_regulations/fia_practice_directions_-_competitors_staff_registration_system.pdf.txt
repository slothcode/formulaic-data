PRACTICE DIRECTIONS 
 

COMPETITOR’S STAFF REGISTRATION SYSTEM  
FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 

 
 

Since the FIA General Assembly of 5 November 2010, the main members of a Competitor’s staff have 
to register with the FIA if they take part in an FIA World Championship. This system, which is based on 
disciplinary and safety considerations, is part of the FIA International Sporting Code (herein referred to 
as the ‘ISC’). 
 
The objective of this system is to preserve and protect the FIA Formula One World Championship by 
depriving, temporarily or definitively, any duly registered member of a Competitor's staff guilty of 
conduct contrary to the FIA Code of Good Standing of the right to access the Reserved Areas at 
events forming part of any FIA World Championship (see Article 30bis of the ISC). 
 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
These Practice Directions have been introduced by the FIA to clarify certain aspects of the new 
system of certificate of registration for the staff of Competitors entered in the FIA Formula One World 
Championship and the way in which the FIA intends to implement the system with regard to the FIA 
Formula One World Championship.  
 
However, these Practice Directions do not amend the ISC or the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules in 
any way. Nor do these Practice Directions limit the discretion of the FIA International Tribunal (herein 
referred to as ‘IT’) or the FIA International Court of Appeal (herein referred to as ‘ICA’).  
 
These Practice Directions will be made available on the FIA website and that in relation to, and at the 
time of, any determination being made by the IT or the ICA the FIA will submit a copy of these Practice 
Directions to the applicable FIA court. 
 

II. REGISTERED MEMBERS OF COMPETITOR’ STAFF 
 
A minimum of 6 persons shall in principle be registered per Competitor:  
 

 Team Principal: the competitor’s most important decision-maker; 
 Sporting Director:  ensures the compliance of the Competitor with the sporting regulations; 
 Technical Director: ensures the compliance of the Competitor with the technical regulations; 
 Team Manager: holds the operational responsibility of the Competitor at the events; 
 2 Race Engineers responsible for the Competitor's cars. 

 
The name of a member of staff may appear in two places on the Competitor registration form, on 
condition that the relevant Competitor justifies to the satisfaction of the FIA, by producing its 
organisational chart, that the individual concerned is indeed performing these two sets of duties. In 
that event an individual would only need one registration.

III. REGISTRATION PROCESS 
 
In the FIA World Championships, it is the responsibility of the Competitors to communicate to the FIA 
the list of the members of their staff who are to be registered as Competitor's Staff.  
 
Each duly registered member of a Competitor's staff will be given, via the Competitor, a Competitor’s 
Staff Certificate of Registration with the FIA (see Appendix 4), a document that is drawn up and issued 
by the FIA and that remains the property of the FIA. 
 

(i) Entry closing date: When applying to enter an FIA World Championship, the Competitor 
must communicate to the FIA the list of the members of their staff who are to be registered as 
Competitor's Staff by providing the FIA with the form drawn up specifically for that purpose 
(see Appendix 4), duly signed and completed. 

 
(ii) Renewal date: 1st of January of each year 

 
(iii) Modification of the list of members of the staff: The Competitor must inform the FIA of this 

within the 7 days following that change and submit an updated list within the same deadline, 
while returning to the FIA the Competitor’s Staff Certificates of Registration of the persons who 
have ceased to perform their role. 

 
The FIA will follow the same procedure for applications during the course of a season as that 
applicable for annual applications. 

 
The FIA will not charge a fee for issuing or renewing a Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration. 
 

IV. REFUSAL TO ISSUE A COMPETITOR’S STAFF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION 
(see applicable procedure in Appendix 1) 

 
The FIA reserves the right to refuse to issue a Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration to any 
person who is under a disciplinary sanction imposed by the IT and/or the ICA or is in breach of the FIA 
Code of Good Standing (see Appendix B to the ISC). 
 
If the FIA, after having received an application for a Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration, 
intends to refuse to grant a Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration, it will, within 8 days after the 
receipt of such application, inform the relevant person and Competitor of such proposed refusal, giving 
its written detailed reasons, and then give the person and the Competitor an opportunity to make 
representations to it in writing (including by email) regarding such refusal within 8 days after having 
received notification of the intended refusal.  
 
If the FIA, having duly considered any representations made by the relevant person and/or the 
Competitor, still intends to refuse to grant a Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration, it may then, 
not later than 8 days after receiving any such representations, or, if no such representations are made, 
after the last date for receiving any such representations, make a decision to the effect that the 
Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration should not be granted (herein referred to as ‘Refusal 
Decision’) and in that event forthwith inform the relevant person and Competitor in writing of the 
Refusal Decision.  
 
Any Refusal Decision of the FIA may be appealed by the relevant person to the ICA in accordance 
with the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules. 
 
With regard to the refusal to issue a competitor’s staff certificate of registration, the FIA will use its best 
endeavours to procure that the ICA will hear and decide on any appeal prior to the beginning of the 
season (not applicable for applications during the course of a season). 
 
If the ICA overturns the Refusal Decision, the Refusal Decision shall cease to have any effect and the 
FIA shall forthwith proceed to grant the Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration to the relevant 
person.

V. WITHDRAWAL AND SUSPENSION OF A COMPETITOR’S STAFF CERTIFICATE OF 
REGISTRATION  

 
The FIA will have regard at all times to the materiality of the breach and safety considerations. 
 
FIA administrative and disciplinary proceedings are subject to the French law, and in particular to the 
principle of proportionality and the free speech principle. 
 

(i) Exercise of the disciplinary power by the FIA:  
(see Appendix 2, item 1) 

 
According to the new FIA disciplinary system (see Appendix 3), the President of the FIA, in his 
capacity as prosecuting body, may take the matter before the IT in accordance with the FIA Judicial 
and Disciplinary Rules.  
 
The IT will, therefore, be competent to establish the existence, or not, of a breach of the FIA 
regulations and to impose any sanction upon the person and Competitor concerned (see the process 
governed by the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules).  
 
The President of the FIA, in its capacity as prosecuting authority, will ask, in respect of every 
disciplinary procedure:  
 

- for the imposition of a suspension upon Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration holders 
who have contravened the FIA Code of Good Standing or the withdrawal of the Competitor’s 
Staff Certificate of Registration (any withdrawal can only be imposed for the remaining period 
of the current season of the FIA Formula One World Championship); and 
 

- that these same people not be fined.  
 
The person and/or Competitor sanctioned may bring an appeal before the ICA against the IT’s 
decision. 
 

********* 
 
The FIA will inform the relevant Competitor of any proceedings instigated against any member of its 
staff. It is the responsibility to the relevant Competitor to send the IT a written request to be heard, and 
if granted, it shall be permitted to submit written observations. The FIA undertakes to support before 
the IT and/or the ICA any request from the Competitor to intervene as a third party within the 
framework of a disciplinary procedure. 
 
The right to deprive any duly registered member of a Competitor’s staff of access to the Reserved 
Areas at events forming part of the FIA Formula One World Championship is subject to the procedure 
set forth in the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules. 
 
The Stewards during the course of an Event or otherwise will have no authority to suspend or 
withdraw a Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration for any breach or alleged breach of the FIA 
Code of Good Standing. 
 

(ii) Provisional Suspension:  
(see Appendix 2, item 2) 

 
In an emergency and where there are exceptional circumstances (which the FIA has the burden of 
establishing), the FIA has the right to suspend provisionally a Competitor’s Staff Certificate of 
Registration in accordance with Article 12 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules:   
 
 If the protection of the participants in an event organised under the aegis of the FIA so requires, 

for reasons of public order or in the interest of motor sport, the IT may, at the request of the 
President of the FIA, provisionally suspend in particular any authorisation, licence or approval 
issued by the FIA, within the framework of a race, competition or other event organised by the 
FIA. This measure cannot exceed a period of three months, renewable once. 



FIA Legal Department  17 March 2011 
Practice Directions - Competitor’s Staff Registration System 

 

4 / 5 

 

 The measure of provisional suspension cannot be pronounced unless the person accused 
has been heard by the IT, or summoned at least 10 days in advance, unless circumstances 
are such that it is necessary to shorten this time limit. 
 

 Unless otherwise stated, the proceedings for hearings under this Article 12 shall be the same for 
hearings under Article 11. 
 

 Provisional suspension, in particular of any authorisation, licence or approval issued on behalf of 
or by the FIA, is not a disciplinary sanction but a safety measure implemented for the 
protection of persons, public order or the interest of motor sport. It does not prevent a 
disciplinary procedure from being instigated, if applicable, for the purpose of imposing 
sanctions for the same acts. 
 

 The person whose provisional suspension is under consideration is summoned to a hearing of 
the IT, convened in an extraordinary meeting as a matter of urgency. This summons contains the 
factual and legal justification for the hearing, and informs the person concerned that he has a 
period of 8 days to submit his observations, that he may be assisted by the lawyer of his choice, 
and that if he fails to appear a decision will be taken on the sole basis of the dossier enclosed 
with the summons. The documents justifying the envisaged measure of suspension are 
appended to the summons. 

 
The FIA will forthwith inform the relevant Competitor of such proceedings. It is the responsibility to 
the relevant Competitor to send the IT a written request to be heard, and if granted, it shall be 
permitted to submit written observations. The FIA undertakes to support before the IT and/or the 
ICA any request from the Competitor to intervene as a third party within the framework of this 
procedure. 

 
 The decision of suspension is fully enforceable as soon as it has been pronounced, and an 

appeal before the ICA does not suspend the enforcement of this sanction. 
 

 The person who has had his authorisation, licence or approval provisionally suspended must 
abstain from any act that is liable to circumvent the measure of suspension. 
 

 The person who is the subject of a provisional suspension may bring an appeal before the ICA. 
 
If the ICA overturns the IT’s decision, the IT’s decision shall cease to have any effect. 
 

 The President of the FIA may request that the IT put an end to the provisional suspension at any 
time, either on his own initiative or at the request of the party concerned, unless the measure has 
been confirmed by the ICA. 

 
VI. OBLIGATIONS OF THE REGISTERED MEMBERS OF THE COMPETITOR'S STAFF 

 
The registered members of the Competitor's staff must observe the FIA Code of Good Standing. 
 
The following sets out examples of the type of behaviours which might constitute an infringement of 
the FIA Code of Good Standing (non-exhaustive list of examples) in relation to a person who is subject 
to the Code of Good Standing: 
 

- giving instructions to a driver or other member of a Competitor’s staff with the intention or with 
the likely result of causing an accident, collision or crash or a race to be stopped or 
suspended; 

- any action which is likely to endanger or materially compromise the safety of any driver, other 
members of the Competitor’s staff, other participants in a race, Officials or any spectators or 
other members of the public who attend an event; 

- giving instructions to make any changes to a car in breach of any safety requirements or 
regulations; 

- giving instructions to tamper with or adversely affect the set-up or performance of the car of 
any other Competitor; 



FIA Legal Department  17 March 2011 
Practice Directions - Competitor’s Staff Registration System 

 

5 / 5 

 

- giving instructions to a driver or otherwise taking any action by which the result or course of a 
race may be influenced or affected for the purpose of profiting or assisting someone to profit 
through betting on the outcome of a race or any part of a race; or 

- being convicted of a criminal offence (other than a driving offence) which carries a maximum 
prison sentence of five years. 

 
VII. AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPETITOR’S STAFF REGISTRATION SYSTEM 

 
The FIA will not make any amendments with regard to the Competitor’s Staff Registration System, 
either to the International Sporting Code or to the Practice Directions, prior consultation with the 
Competitors entered in the FIA Formula One World Championship and adequate opportunity to 
provide input on the proposed amendments.
