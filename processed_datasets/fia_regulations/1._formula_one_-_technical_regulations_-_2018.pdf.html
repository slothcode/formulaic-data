</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2 : GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
</p>
<p>2.1 Role of the FIA : 
</p>
<p> The following technical regulations for Formula One cars are issued by the FIA. 
</p>
<p>2.2 Amendments to the regulations : 
</p>
<p> These Technical Regulations apply to the Championship taking place in the calendar year 
referred to in the title (“the Championship”) and may only be changed after 30 April of the 
preceding year with the unanimous agreement of all competitors, save for changes made by 
the FIA for safety reasons which may come into effect without notice or delay. 
</p>
<p>2.3 Dangerous construction : 
</p>
<p> The stewards may exclude a vehicle whose construction is deemed to be dangerous. 
</p>
<p>2.4 Compliance with the regulations : 
</p>
<p> Automobiles must comply with these regulations in their entirety at all times during an Event. 
</p>
<p> Should a competitor introduce a new design or system or feel that any aspect of these 
regulations is unclear, clarification may be sought from the FIA Formula One Technical 
Department. If clarification relates to any new design or system, correspondence must 
include: 
</p>
<p> a) A full description of the design or system. 
</p>
<p> b) Drawings or schematics where appropriate. 
</p>
<p> c) The competitor's opinion concerning the immediate implications on other parts of the 
car of any proposed new design. 
</p>
<p> d) The competitor's opinion concerning any possible long term consequences or new 
developments which may come from using any such new designs or systems. 
</p>
<p> e) The precise way or ways in which the competitor feels the new design or system will 
enhance the performance of the car. 
</p>
<p>2.5 New systems or technologies : 
</p>
<p> Any new system, procedure or technology not specifically covered by these regulations, but 
which is deemed permissible by the FIA Formula One Technical Department, will only be 
admitted until the end of the Championship during which it is introduced. Following this the 
Formula One Commission will be asked to review the technology concerned and, if they feel it 
adds no value to Formula One in general, it will be specifically prohibited. 
</p>
<p> Any team whose technology is prohibited in this way will then be required to publish full 
technical details of the relevant system or procedure. 
</p>
<p>2.6 Measurements : 
</p>
<p> All measurements must be made while the car is stationary on a flat horizontal surface. 
</p>
<p>2.7 Duty of Competitor : 
</p>
<p> It is the duty of each competitor to satisfy the FIA technical delegate and the stewards that his 
automobile complies with these regulations in their entirety at all times during an Event. 
</p>
<p> The design of the car, its components and systems shall, with the exception of safety features, 
demonstrate their compliance with these regulations by means of physical inspection of 
hardware or materials. No mechanical design may rely upon software inspection as a means of 
ensuring its compliance. </p>

more than 250mm from the car centre plane, must be no less than 75mm and no more than 
275mm above the reference plane. 
</p>
<p> When viewed from above, this bodywork must lie within the area enclosed by the intersection 
of four lines: 
</p>
<p> a) A diagonal line from a point 1200mm forward of the front wheel centre line and on the 
car centre plane to a point 1000mm in front of the front wheel centre line and 900mm

<p> d) A longitudinal line parallel to and 250mm from the car centre plane. 
</p>
<p>3.3.2 Mandatory central section 
</p>
<p> Any vertical section taken parallel to the car centre plane through bodywork located more 
than 450mm forward of the front wheel centre line, less than 250mm from the car centre 
plane, and less than 125mm above the reference plane must only contain a single section, 
which : 
</p>
<p>- Conforms to the profile and incidence defined by the coordinates specified in 
Drawing 7 (with the exception of local changes of section where the bodywork 
defined in Article 3.3.3 attaches) with a manufacturing tolerance of +/-0.500mm.

between 125mm and 135mm above the reference plane, may only contain two closed 
symmetrical sections with a maximum total area of 5000mm2. The thickness of each section 
may not exceed 25mm when measured perpendicular to the car centre plane. 
</p>
<p> Once fully defined, the sections at 125mm above the reference plane must be projected 
vertically to join the profile required by Article 3.3.2. A radius no greater than 10mm may be 
used where these sections join. 
</p>

<p>3.6 Rear wing and rear impact structure 
</p>
<p>3.6.1 Height 
</p>
<p>No part of the bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line may be more than 800mm above 
the reference plane. 
</p>
<p>3.6.2 Width 
</p>
<p>a)  The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and more than 450mm above 
the reference plane must not exceed 950mm. 
</p>
<p>b) The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and between 200mm and 
450mm above the reference plane must not exceed 840mm. 
</p>
<p>3.6.3 Rear wing profiles 
</p>
<p>Other than the bodywork defined in Article 3.6.6, any bodywork behind the rear wheel centre 
line which is more than 600mm above the reference plane, and less than 455mm from the car 
centre plane, must lie in an area when viewed from the side of the car that is situated 
between 150mm and 500mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line. 
</p>
<p>With the exception of the bodywork associated with adjustment of the section in accordance 
with Article 3.6.8: 
</p>
<p> a) When viewed from the side of the car, no longitudinal vertical cross section may have 
more than two sections in this area, each of which must be closed. 
</p>
<p> b) No part of these longitudinal vertical cross sections in contact with the external air 
stream may have a local concave radius of curvature smaller than 100mm. 
</p>
<p> Any bodywork associated with the adjustment of the rearmost section in accordance with 
Article 3.6.8 must be located either less than 25mm from the longitudinal centre line of car or 
more than 450mm from the longitudinal centreline of the car. 
</p>
<p> Once the rearmost and uppermost section is defined, ‘gurney’ type trim tabs may be fitted to 
the trailing edge. When measured in any longitudinal vertical cross section no dimension of 
any such trim tab may exceed 20mm. 
</p>
<p> The chord of the rearmost and uppermost closed section must always be smaller than the 
chord of the lowermost section at the same lateral station. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, the distance between adjacent sections at any longitudinal vertical plane must 
lie between 10mm and 15mm at their closest position, except, in accordance with Article 
3.6.8, when this distance must lie between 10mm and 65mm. </p>

</p>
<p>3.6.4 Separators 
</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the individual profiles and the relationship between these two sections 
can only change whilst the car is in motion in accordance with Article 3.6.8, they must be 
bridged by means of pairs of rigid impervious supports arranged such that no part of the 
trailing edge of the forward section may be more than 250mm laterally from a pair of 
supports. These pairs of supports must : 
</p>
<p> a) Be located no more than 455mm from the car centre plane. 
</p>
<p> b) Fully enclose each complete section such that their inner profiles match that of each 
section. With the exception of minimal local changes where the two sections are 
adjacent to each other, their outer profiles must be offset from the inner profiles by 
between 8mm and 30mm and may not incorporate any radius smaller than 10mm 
(‘gurney’ type trim tabs may however be fitted between the supports). 
</p>
<p> c) Be aligned as a pair so as to provide a bearing across their full thickness and along a 
profile length of at least 10mm when the distance between the two sections is at its 
closest position. 
</p>
<p> d) Not be recessed into the wing profiles (where a recess is defined as a reduction in 
section at a rate greater than 45° with respect to a lateral axis). 
</p>
<p> e) Be arranged so that any curvature occurs only in a horizontal plane (other than when 
this bodywork is adjusted in accordance with Article 3.6.8). 
</p>
<p> f) Be between 2mm and 5mm thick. 
</p>
<p> g) Be rigidly fixed to their respective sections. 
</p>
<p> h) Be constructed from a material with modulus greater than 50GPa. 
</p>
<p> These supports will be ignored when assessing whether the car is in compliance with Articles 
3.6.1, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 3.6.6 and 3.6.7. 
</p>
<p>3.6.5 Rear impact structure 
</p>
<p>Any parts of the car less than 100mm from the car centre plane and more than 500mm behind 
the rear wheel centre line must be situated between 200mm and 400mm above the reference 
plane. 
</p>
<p>With the exception of the last 150mm of the tailpipes described in Article 5.8, there must be 
no bodywork in an area less than 100mm from the car centre plane, more than 200mm 
behind the rear wheel centre line and between 400mm and 550mm above the reference 
plane. 
</p>
<p>3.6.6 Pylons 
</p>
<p>Any horizontal section between 550mm and 600mm above the reference plane, taken

<p>3.7 Floor and diffuser 
</p>
<p> Compliance with this Article must be demonstrated with all unsprung parts of the car 
removed. 
</p>
<p>3.7.1 Step and reference planes 
</p>
<p>With the parts referred to in Articles 3.7.10, 3.7.11 and 3.7.12 removed all sprung parts of the 
car situated from 430mm behind the front wheel centre line to 175mm in front of the rear 
wheel centre line, and which are visible from underneath, must form surfaces which lie on one 
of two parallel planes, the reference plane or the step plane. This does not apply to any parts 
of rear view mirrors which are visible, provided each of these areas does not exceed 
16000mm² when projected to a horizontal plane above the car. 
</p>
<p> The step plane must be 50mm above the reference plane. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, the surface formed by all parts lying on the reference plane must : 
</p>
<p> a) Cover the area which is bounded by two transversal lines, one 430mm behind the front 
wheel centre line and the other on the rear wheel centre line, and two longitudinal lines 
150mm either side of the car centre plane. 
</p>
<p> b) Have a maximum width of 500mm. 
</p>
<p> c) Be symmetrical about the car centre plane. 
</p>
<p> d) Have a 50mm radius (+/-2mm) on each front corner when viewed from directly beneath 
the car, this being applied after the surface has been defined. </p>

</p>
<p>3.7.2 Transition 
</p>
<p>The surface lying on the reference plane must be joined around its periphery to the surfaces 
lying on the step plane by a vertical transition. If there is no surface visible on the step plane 
vertically above any point around the periphery of the reference plane, this transition is not 
necessary. 
</p>
<p>3.7.3 Boundaries 
</p>
<p>The surface lying on the reference plane may be curved upwards at its boundaries with an arc 
of constant curvature whose radius of curvature is no greater than 25mm, with no inflection, 
which is tangential to the surface and applied perpendicular to the boundary. In no case may 
the arc start further than 25mm from the boundary (when measured on the surface and 
perpendicular to this boundary). 
</p>
<p>Where the vertical transition meets the surfaces on the step plane a radius no greater than 
25mm is permitted (a radius in this context will be considered as an arc of constant curvature 
applied perpendicular to the boundary and tangential to both surfaces).  
</p>
<p>The surfaces lying on the step plane which do not meet one of the vertical transitions may be 
curved upwards at their boundaries with an arc whose radius of curvature is no greater than 
100mm at any point, with no inflection, which is tangential to the surface and applied 
perpendicular to the boundary. In no case may the arc start further than 100mm from the 
boundary (when measured on the surface and perpendicular to this boundary). 
</p>
<p>The surface lying on the reference plane, the surfaces lying on the step plane, the vertical 
transitions between them and any surfaces rearward of the surfaces lying on the reference or 
step planes, must first be fully defined before any radius can be applied or the parts referred 
to in Articles 3.7.10, 3.7.11 and 3.7.12 fitted. Any radius applied is still considered part of the 
relevant surface. 
</p>
<p>3.7.4 Floor construction 
</p>
<p>All parts lying on the reference and step planes, in addition to the transition between the two 
planes, must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous, rigid (no degree of freedom in relation 
to the unit comprising the survival cell/power unit/gearbox), impervious surfaces under all 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>3.7.5 Tolerances 
</p>
<p>To help overcome any possible manufacturing problems, and not to permit any design which 
may contravene any part of these regulations, the following dimensional tolerances are 
permitted on bodywork situated between 430mm behind the front wheel centre line and the 
rear wheel centre line: a vertical tolerance of +/- 3mm is permissible across the surfaces lying 
on the reference and step planes and a horizontal tolerance of 3mm is permitted when 
assessing whether a surface is visible from beneath the car. 
</p>
<p>3.7.6 Diffuser width  
</p>
<p>The width of bodywork behind the rear wheel centre line and less than 200mm above the 
reference plane must not exceed 1050mm. </p>
<p></p>
</div>

</p>
<p>3.7.7 Diffuser length 
</p>
<p> No part of the car between 100mm and 525mm from the car centre plane and less than 
200mm above the reference plane may be more than 350mm behind the rear wheel centre 
line. 
</p>
<p>3.7.8 Diffuser height and construction 
</p>
<p>a) No bodywork which is visible from beneath the car and which lies between 175mm 
forward of the rear wheel centre line and 350mm rearward of the rear wheel centre 
line may be more than 175mm above the reference plane. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, any bodywork in this area must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous 
(no fully enclosed holes), rigid (no degree of freedom in relation to the unit comprising 
the survival cell/power unit/gearbox), impervious surfaces under all circumstances. 
</p>
<p>b)  All sprung parts of the car situated behind a line 175mm in front of the rear wheel 
centre line, which are visible from underneath and are more than 250mm from the car 
centre plane, must be at least 50mm above the reference plane. 
</p>
<p>3.7.9 Continuity 
</p>
<p>a) In an area lying 450mm or less from the car centre plane, and from 450mm forward of 
the plane C-C to 350mm rearward of the rear wheel centre line, any intersection of any 
bodywork visible from beneath the car with a lateral or longitudinal vertical plane 
should form one continuous line which is visible from beneath the car. 
</p>
<p>b) In an area lying 700mm or less from the car centre plane, and from 450mm forward of 
the plane C-C to 350mm forward of the rear wheel centre line, any intersection of any 
bodywork visible from beneath the car with a lateral or longitudinal vertical plane 
should form one continuous line which is visible from beneath the car. 
</p>
<p>3.7.10 Plank 
</p>
<p>Beneath the surface formed by all parts lying on the reference plane, a rectangular plank, with 
a 50mm radius (+/-2mm) on each front corner, must be fitted. This plank may comprise no 
more than three pieces, the forward one of which may not be any less than 900mm in length, 
but must : 
</p>

the rear wheel centre line. 
</p>
<p> b) Have a width of 300mm with a tolerance of +/- 2mm. 
</p>
<p> c) Be made from an homogeneous material with a specific gravity between 1.3 and 1.45,

homogeneous material with a specific gravity of between 1.3 and 1.45. 
</p>
<p> d) Have a thickness of 10mm with a tolerance of +/-1mm. 
</p>
<p> e) Have a uniform thickness when new. 
</p>
<p> f) Pocketing of the lower 9.5mm of the plank from above is permitted between 630mm to 
880mm and from 1280mm behind the front wheel centre line, however the pocket 
depth may not reduce the remaining plank material thickness to less than 2mm from 
either the lowest surface below the reference plane when new or the lower surface of 
any recesses necessary to fit the skids permitted by Article 3.7.11. Furthermore, the 
periphery of any pocket, in any horizontal plane parallel to the reference plane, must be 
not less than 10mm from either the edges of the plank or any holes or recesses in the 
plank. In vertical cross section the internal pocket fillet radii must be at least 3mm and 
in horizontal cross section 10mm. Pockets may only be filled with a material having a 
specific gravity of less than 0.25. </p>

</p>
<p>  Four further 10mm diameter holes are permitted provided their sole purpose is to allow 
access to the bolts which secure the Accident Data Recorder to the survival cell. 
</p>

<p>3.8 Aerodynamic influence 
</p>
<p> With the exception of the ducts described in Article 11.4, any specific part of the car 
influencing its aerodynamic performance: 
</p>
<p> a) Must comply with the rules relating to bodywork. 
</p>
<p> b) Must be rigidly secured to the entirely sprung part of the car (rigidly secured means not 
having any degree of freedom). 
</p>
<p> With the exception of the driver adjustable bodywork described in Article 3.6.8 (in addition to 
minimal parts solely associated with its actuation) and the ducts described in Article 11.4, any 
specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance must remain immobile in 
relation to the sprung part of the car. 
</p>
<p> Any device or construction that is designed to bridge the gap between the sprung part of the 
car and the ground is prohibited under all circumstances. 
</p>
<p> No part having an aerodynamic influence and no part of the bodywork, with the exception of 
the parts referred to in Articles 3.7.10, 3.7.11 and 3.7.12, may under any circumstances be 
located below the reference plane. 
</p>
<p> With the exception of the parts necessary for the adjustment described in Article 3.6.8, any 
car system, device or procedure which uses driver movement as a means of altering the 
aerodynamic characteristics of the car is prohibited.

<p>3.9 Bodywork flexibility 
</p>
<p>3.9.1 Bodywork may deflect no more than 15mm vertically when a 1000N load is applied vertically 
to it at points 675mm and 975mm forward of the front wheel centre line and 795mm from 
the car centre plane. The load will be applied in a downward direction using a 50mm diameter 
ram on a rectangular adapter measuring 400mm x 150mm. This adapter must be supplied by 
the team and : 
</p>
<p> a) Have a flat top surface without recesses. 
</p>
<p> b) Be fitted to the car so as to apply the full load to the bodywork at the test point and not 
to increase the rigidity of the parts being tested. 
</p>
<p> c) Be placed with the inner 400mm edge parallel to the car centre plane and displaced 
from it by 720mm. 
</p>
<p> d) Be placed with its forward edge 1025mm forward of the front wheel centre line. 
</p>
<p> The deflection will be measured along the loading axis at the bottom of the bodywork at this 
point and relative to the reference plane. 
</p>
<p>3.9.2 Bodywork may deflect no more than 10mm vertically when a 500N load is applied vertically to 
it 450mm forward of the rear wheel centre line and 650mm from the car centre plane. The 
load will be applied in a downward direction using a 50mm diameter ram and an adapter of 
the same size. Teams must supply the latter when such a test is deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p>3.9.3 Bodywork may deflect by no more than one degree horizontally when a load of 1000N is 
applied simultaneously to its extremities in a rearward direction 775mm above the reference 
plane and 20mm forward of the forward edge of the rear wing endplate at 775mm above the 
reference plane. 
</p>
<p>3.9.4 Bodywork may deflect no more than 2mm vertically when a 500N load is applied 
simultaneously to each side of it 250mm behind the rear wheel centre line, 325mm from the 
car centre plane and 820mm above the reference plane. The deflection will be measured at 
the outer extremities of the bodywork at a point 395mm behind the rear wheel centre line. 
</p>
<p> The load will be applied in a downward direction through pads measuring 200mm x 100mm 
which conform to the shape of the bodywork beneath them, and with their uppermost 
horizontal surface 820mm above the reference plane. The load will be applied to the centre of 
area of the pads. Teams must supply the latter when such a test is deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p>3.9.5 Bodywork may deflect no more than 5mm vertically when a 4000N load is applied vertically to 
it at three different points which lie on the car centre plane and 100mm either side of it. Each 
of these loads will be applied in an upward direction at a point 480mm rearward of the front 
wheel centre line using a 50mm diameter ram in the two outer locations and a 70mm 
diameter ram on the car centre plane. 
</p>
<p> Stays or structures between the front of the bodywork lying on the reference plane and the 
survival cell may be present for this test, provided they are completely rigid and have no 
system or mechanism which allows non-linear deflection during any part of the test. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, the bodywork being tested in this area may not include any component which is 
capable of allowing more than the permitted amount of deflection under the test load 
(including any linear deflection above the test load), such components could include, but are 
not limited to : 
</p>
<p> a) Joints, bearings pivots or any other form of articulation. 
</p>
<p> b) Dampers, hydraulics or any form of time dependent component or structure. 
</p>
<p> c) Buckling members or any component or design which may have any non-linear 
characteristics. 
</p>
<p> d) Any parts which may systematically or routinely exhibit permanent deformation. </p>

</p>
<p>3.9.6 The uppermost aerofoil element lying behind the rear wheel centre line may deflect no more 
than 5mm horizontally when a 500N load is applied horizontally. The load will be applied 
800mm above the reference plane at three separate points which lie on the car centre plane 
and 240mm either side of it. The loads will be applied in a rearward direction using a suitable 
25mm wide adapter which must be supplied by the relevant team. 
</p>
<p>3.9.7 The forward-most aerofoil element lying behind the rear wheel centre line and which lies 
more than 580mm above the reference plane may deflect no more than 2mm vertically when 
a 200N load is applied vertically. The load will be applied in line with the trailing edge of the 
element at any point across its width. 
</p>
<p> The loads will be applied using a suitable adapter, supplied by the relevant team, which : 
</p>
<p> a) May be no more than 50mm wide. 
</p>
<p> b) Which extends no more than 10mm forward of the trailing edge. 
</p>
<p> c) Incorporates an 8mm female thread in the underside. 
</p>
<p>3.9.8 Any part of the trailing edge of any front wing flap may deflect no more than 5mm, when 
measured along the loading axis, when a 60N point load is applied normal to the flap. 
</p>
<p>3.9.9 In order to ensure that the requirements of Article 3.8 are respected, the FIA reserves the 
right to introduce further load/deflection tests on any part of the bodywork which appears to 
be (or is suspected of), moving whilst the car is in motion. 
</p>
<p>3.10 Bodywork construction 
</p>
<p>3.10.1 In order to avoid the spread of debris on the track following an accident, the outer skins of the 
front wing endplates and any turning vanes in the vicinity of the front wheels (and any 
similarly vulnerable bodywork parts in this area), must be made predominantly from materials 
which are included for the specific purpose of containing debris. 
</p>
<p> The FIA must be satisfied that all such parts are constructed in order to achieve the stated 
objective.

</p>
<p>9.2.1 If multiple clutch operating devices are used, they must all have the same mechanical travel 
characteristics and be mapped identically. 
</p>
<p>9.2.2 Designs which allow specific points along the travel range of the clutch operating device to be 
identified by the driver or assist him to hold a position are not permitted. 
</p>
<p>9.2.3 The minimum and maximum travel positions of the clutch operating device must correspond 
to the clutch fully engaged normal rest position and fully disengaged (incapable of 
transmitting any useable torque) positions respectively. 
</p>
<p>9.2.4 Designs or systems which in addition to typical inherent hydraulic and mechanical properties 
are designed to, or have the effect of, adjusting or otherwise influencing the amount, or rate, 
of engagement being demanded by the FIA ECU, are not permitted. 
</p>
<p>9.2.5 The amount by which the clutch is engaged must be controlled solely and directly by the

thickness of at least 2mm. 
</p>
<p>9.5 Gearboxes : 
</p>
<p>9.5.1 A gearbox is defined as all the parts in the drive line which transfer torque from the power unit 
output shaft, as described in Article 5.3.2, to the drive shafts (the drive shafts being defined as 
those components which transfer drive torque from the sprung mass to the un-sprung mass). 
It includes all components whose primary purpose is for the transmission of power or 
mechanical selection of gears, bearings associated with these components and the casing in 
which they are housed. 
</p>
<p>9.5.2 In this context the following parts are not considered part of the gearbox and may be changed 
without incurring a penalty under the F1 Sporting Regulations. If changing any of these parts 
involves breaking an FIA applied seal this may be done but must be carried out under FIA 
supervision : 
</p>
<p> a) The clutch assembly and the power unit output shaft, provided this is located prior to 
any mechanical speed reduction from the engine. 
</p>
<p> b) The clutch actuator and clutch release bearing(s). 
</p>
<p> c) Inboard driveshaft joints and seals but not their housing if that housing is integral with 
the gearbox output shaft and therefore part of the sprung mass. 
</p>
<p> d) The hydraulic system prior to the point at which it produces direct mechanical 
movement of the gear selection mechanism by means of hydraulic actuator(s). 
</p>
<p> e) Oil, oil pumps, oil filters, oil seals, oil coolers and any associated hoses or pipes. 
</p>
<p> f) Electrical sensors, actuators, servo valves and wiring. 
</p>
<p> g) Any parts associated with the suspension or functioning of the sprung suspension that 
are attached to the gearbox casing. 
</p>
<p> h) The rear impact structure provided it can be separated from any gearbox casing. 
</p>
<p> i) Any other component mounted to the casing whose primary purpose is unconnected 
with the transmission of power or selection of gears. 
</p>
<p>9.6 Gear ratios : 
</p>
<p>9.6.1 The number of forward gear ratios must be 8. 
</p>
<p>9.6.2 Each competitor must nominate the forward gear ratios (calculated from engine crankshaft to 
drive shafts) to be employed within their gearbox. These nominations must be declared to the 
FIA technical delegate at or before the first Event of the Championship.  </p>
<p></p>

<div class="page"><p></p>
<p>  
2018 F1 Technical Regulations 56/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 
</p>
<p>9.6.3 No forward gear ratio pair may be : 
</p>
<p> a) Less than 12mm wide when measured across the gear tooth at the root diameter or any 
point 1mm above or below the root diameter. Above this area each side of the gear 
teeth may be chamfered by a maximum of 10˚. In addition, a chamfer or radius not 
exceeding 2.0mm may be applied to the sides and the tip of the teeth. 
</p>
<p> b) Less than 85mm between centres. 
</p>
<p> c) Less than 600g in weight (excluding any integral shaft or collar). If an integral shaft or 
collar is to be excluded the mass of this may be shown by calculation assuming the gear 
to be 12mm wide and the shaft geometry to be the same as that where slide on gears 
are used. 
</p>
<p>9.6.4 Gear ratios must be made from steel. 
</p>
<p>9.6.5 Continuously variable transmission systems are not permitted to transmit the power of the 
power unit defined in Article 5.1. 
</p>
<p>9.7 Reverse gear : 
</p>
<p> All cars must be able to be driven in reverse by the driver at any time during the Event. 
</p>
<p>9.8 Gear changing : 
</p>
<p>9.8.1 Automatic gear changes are considered a driver aid and are therefore not permitted. 
</p>
<p> For the purposes of gear changing, the clutch and power unit torque need not be under the 
control of the driver. 
</p>
<p>9.8.2 Gear changing is restricted during the following periods : 
</p>
<p> One gear change is permitted after the race has started and before the car speed has reached 
80km/h, provided every gear fitted to the car is capable of achieving at least 80km/h at 
15,000rpm. 
</p>
<p>9.8.3 The minimum possible gear the driver is able to select must remain fixed whilst the car is 
moving. 
</p>
<p> Each individual gear change must be separately initiated by the driver and, within the 
mechanical constraints of the gearbox; the requested gear must be engaged immediately 
unless over-rev protection is used to reject the gear shift request. Once a gear change request 
has been accepted no further requests may be accepted until the first gear change has been 
completed. 
</p>
<p> Multiple gear changes may only be made under Article 5.22 or when a shift to gearbox neutral 
is made following a request from the driver. 
</p>
<p> If an over-rev protection strategy is used this may only prevent engagement of the target gear, 
it must not induce a delay greater than 50ms. If a gear change is refused in this way, 
engagement may only follow a new and separate request made by the driver. 
</p>
<p> Any de-bounce time used to condition driver gear change requests must be fixed. 
</p>
<p>9.8.4 The maximum permitted duration for down changes and up changes is 300ms and 200ms 
respectively. The maximum permitted delay for the latter is 80ms from the time of the driver 
request to the original gear being disengaged. 
</p>
<p> The duration of a gear change is defined as the time from the request being made to the point 
at which all gear change processes are terminated. If for any reason the gear change cannot 
be completed in that time the car must be left in neutral or the original gear. 
</p>
<p>9.8.5 Distance channel or track position is not considered an acceptable input to gearbox control. </p>

results only from changes in load applied to the rear wheels. 
</p>
<p>10.2 Suspension geometry : 
</p>
<p>10.2.1 With the steering wheel fixed, the position of each wheel centre and the orientation of its 
rotation axis must be completely and uniquely defined by a function of its principally 
vertical suspension travel, save only for the effects of reasonable compliance which does 
not intentionally provide further degrees of freedom. 
</p>
<p>10.2.2 Any powered device which is capable of altering the configuration or affecting the 
performance of any part of any suspension system is forbidden. 
</p>
<p>10.2.3 No adjustment may be made to any suspension system while the car is in motion. 
</p>
<p>10.3 Suspension members : 
</p>
<p>10.3.1 With the exception of minimal local changes of section for the passage of hydraulic brake 
lines, electrical wiring and wheel tethers or the attachment of flexures, rod ends and spherical

bend radius greater than 7.5mm. 
</p>
<p>Each team must supply detailed geometries which clearly show that any two of the three 
tethers will independently prevent a wheel from making contact with a driver’s head during an 
accident, assuming 7kJ energy absorption in each tether. 
</p>
<p>10.4 Steering : 
</p>
<p>10.4.1 Any steering system which permits the re-alignment of more than two wheels is not 
permitted.

2018 F1 Technical Regulations 67/105 19 December 2017 
© 2017 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile 
</p>
<p>14.6.2 The first area of padding for the driver’s head must be positioned behind him and be between 
75mm and 90mm thick over an area of at least 40000mm². If necessary, and only for driver 
comfort, an additional piece of padding no greater than 10mm thick may be attached to this 
headrest provided it is made from the same material. 
</p>
<p>14.6.3 Whilst he is seated normally the two further areas of padding for the driver’s head must be 
positioned in an area bounded by two vertical lines and one horizontal line through the front, 
rear and lower extremities of the driver’s helmet (on the car centre plane), and the upper 
surface of the survival cell. 
</p>
<p> Each of these must cover an area greater than 35750mm² when viewed from the side of the 
car and be no less than 95mm thick, this minimum thickness being maintained to the upper 
edges of the survival cell and over their entire length. The minimum thickness will be assessed 
perpendicular to the car centre plane but a radius no greater than 10mm may be applied 
along their upper inboard edges. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, any void between these areas of padding and the area described in Article 
14.6.2 must also be completely filled with the same material. 
</p>
<p> If necessary, and only for driver comfort, an additional piece of padding no greater than 20mm 
thick may be attached to these headrests provided they are made from the same material 
which incorporates a low friction surface. 
</p>
<p>14.6.4 Forward of the side areas of padding further cockpit padding must be provided on each side of 
the cockpit rim. The purpose of the additional padding is to afford protection to the driver's 
head in the event of an oblique frontal impact and must therefore be made from the same 
material as the other three areas of padding. 
</p>
<p> These extensions must : 
</p>
<p> a) Be symmetrically positioned about the car centre plane and a continuation of the side 
areas of padding. 
</p>
<p> b) Be positioned with their upper surfaces at least as high as the survival cell over their 
entire length. 
</p>
<p> c) Have a radius on their upper inboard edge no greater than 10mm. 
</p>
<p> d) Be positioned in order that the distance between the two is no less than 320mm. 
</p>
<p> e) Be as high as practicable within the constraints of driver comfort. 
</p>
<p>14.6.5 All of the padding described above must be so installed that if movement of the driver's head, 
in any expected trajectory during an accident, were to compress the foam fully at any point, 
his helmet would not make contact with any structural part of the car. 
</p>
<p>14.6.6 No part of the padding described above may obscure sight of any part of the driver's helmet 
when he is seated normally and viewed from directly above the car. 
</p>
<p>14.6.7 In order to minimise the risk of leg injury during an accident, additional areas of padding must 
be fitted each side of, and above, the driver’s legs. 
</p>
<p>These areas of padding must: 
</p>
<p> a) Be made from a material described in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p> b) Be no less than 25mm thick over their entire area. 
</p>
<p> c) Cover the area situated between the plane B-B and 100mm behind the face of the 
rearmost pedal when in the inoperative position, as shown in Drawing 4. 
</p>
<p> d) Cover the area above the plane A-A shown in Drawing 3. </p>

</p>
<p>The rear face of the cockpit entry template, whilst held in the position described in Article 
13.1.1, defines the position of the plane C-C. 
</p>
<p>The car centre plane is the plane of symmetry of the cockpit entry template, whilst held in the 
position described in Article 13.1.1, perpendicular to the reference plane and to C-C. 
</p>
<p>The plane B-B is parallel to and lies 875mm forward of C-C. 
</p>
<p>The plane A-A is parallel to and lies no less than 1800mm forward of C-C. 
 The survival cell front bulkhead must be on or forward of the plane A-A. 
</p>
<p>The external width of the survival cell between the planes B-B and C-C must be no less than 
450mm and must be at least 60mm per side wider than the cockpit opening when measured 
normal to the inside of the cockpit aperture. These minimum dimensions must be maintained 
over a height of at least 350mm. 
</p>
<p>Between the planes A-A and B-B, any external cross-section of the survival cell by a plane 
parallel to C-C must contain a rectangle with radii applied on its four corners, positioned 
symmetrically about the car centre plane, of the following dimensions : 
</p>
<p>a) Width defined by a linear interpolation from 450mm at the plane B-B to 300mm at the 
plane A-A. 
</p>
<p>b) Height defined by a linear interpolation from 400mm at the plane B-B to 275mm at the 
plane A-A. 
</p>
<p>c) Corner radii defined by a linear interpolation from 50mm at the plane B-B to 25mm at 
the plane A-A. 
</p>
<p> No part of the survival cell, nor any part rigidly attached to it (with the exception of the panel 
of prescribed laminate referred to in Article 3.4.2, pitot tubes and antennae), which lies 
between the plane A-A and a parallel plane 375mm behind of A-A, may lie above a diagonal 
plane defined by a line on A-A, parallel to and 525mm above the reference plane and a parallel 
line, 375mm rearward of A-A and 625mm above the reference plane. 
</p>
<p>The maximum height of the survival cell between the planes A-A and B-B is 625mm above the 
reference plane. 
</p>
<p>15.4.4 When the test referred to in Article 13.1.1 is carried out and the template is in position with its 
lower face parallel to and 525mm above the reference plane, the shape of the survival cell 
must be such that no part of it is visible when viewed from either side of the car. The parts of 
the survival cell which are situated each side of the driver's head must be no more than 
550mm apart. 
</p>
<p> In order to ensure that the driver’s head is not unduly exposed and for him to maintain good 
lateral visibility he must, when seated normally and looking straight ahead with his head as far 
back as possible, have his eye visible when viewed from the side. The centre of gravity of his 
head must lie below the top of the survival cell at this position. When viewed from the side of 
the car, the centre of gravity of the driver’s head will be deemed to be the intersection of a 
vertical line passing through the centre of his ear and a horizontal line passing through the 
centre of his eye. 
</p>
<p>15.4.5 In order to give additional protection to the driver in the event of a side impact a flat test 
panel of uniform construction, which is designed and constructed in order to represent a 
section of the survival cell sides, must pass a strength test. Details of the test procedure may 
be found in Article 18.7. 
</p>
<p> Referring to Drawing 5, with the exception of local reinforcement and/or inserts, all parts of 
the survival cell which are as wide or wider than the minimum widths stipulated in Article 
15.4.3, including any radii applied, must be manufactured to the same specification as a single 
panel which satisfies the requirements of Article 18.7. However, additional plies may be used 
and core thickness may be increased where applicable, and local relief applied, provided the 
FIA technical delegate is satisfied in each case that the overall strength of the structure has 
been improved by doing so. </p>

further panel, which may be made in a maximum of three parts but which is no less than 
3.0mm thick, constructed from seven plies of Zylon and two plies of carbon (precise lay-up 
instructions may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations), must then be 
permanently attached to the survival cell with an appropriate adhesive which has been 
applied over its entire surface including all overlapping joints. 
</p>
<p> This panel must, in side view, cover the area of the outer skin of the survival cell lying between 
a plane parallel to and 300mm rearward of A-A, a plane parallel to and 650mm forward of C-C 
and two planes parallel to and 60mm and 550mm above the reference plane. This will not

</p>
<p>15.5.2 Between the principal and secondary roll structures, two impact absorbing structures must be 
fitted on each side of the survival cell and must be solidly attached to it. The purpose of these 
structures is to protect the driver in the event of a lateral impact and, in order to ensure this is 
the case, strength tests of the mountings must be carried out successfully. Details of the test 
procedure may be found in Articles 18.9 and 18.10. 
</p>
<p> The impact absorbing structures must be manufactured and mounted to the survival cell in 
accordance with the following specifications : 
</p>
<p> a) The construction and geometry of the structures may be found in the Appendix to the 
Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p> b) The structures must be mounted with the principal axes of their prismatic mounting 
sections perpendicular to the longitudinal and vertical centre plane of the car, and with 
the centres of area of their outermost longitudinal vertical cross sections positioned : 
</p>
<p> i) Longitudinally : 500mm (+/-25mm) forward of the plane C-C and within 1mm of 
each other. 
</p>
<p> ii) Vertically : Between 400mm and 520mm above the reference plane and between 
70mm and 190mm above the reference plane for the upper and lower structures 
respectively. 
</p>
<p> iii) Laterally : Within 1mm of each other. 
</p>
<p> Refer to the drawings which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p> c) Mountings must be permanently bonded to the structures to enable them to be 
attached to the survival cell, each of them must : 
</p>
<p> i) Incorporate a closed end and internal abutment to the impact structure that 
must be capable of withstanding the lateral load described in Article18.10 
without a structural contribution from the bonded interface. 
</p>
<p> ii) Lie entirely inboard of a plane which lies 292mm inboard of the outermost 
longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure. 
</p>
<p> iii) Be arranged in order that the outermost surface created by an interface 
between the mounting and structure lies on a vertical surface that is located 
within the zone indicated in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p> iv) Be arranged in order that the innermost extent of the bonded interface 
between the mounting and structure is offset inboard by a minimum of 44mm 
from the vertical surface defined in (iii) above. 
</p>
<p> v) Be arranged in order that the bonded interface covers the entire external area 
of the structure between the innermost and outermost extents defined in iii) 
and iv) above. 
</p>
<p> d) To allow for debris compaction, the internal volume of the : 
</p>
<p> i) Upper structure must be empty outboard of a vertical plane intersecting the 
structure leading edge at 367mm and trailing edge at 342mm measured from the 
outermost longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure as indicated 
in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p> ii) Lower structure must be empty outboard of a vertical plane intersecting the 
structure leading edge at 382mm and trailing edge at 357mm measured from the 
outermost longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structure as indicated 
in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p> No parts which, in the opinion of the FIA technical delegate, would prevent proper function of 
the impact structures in the event of a lateral impact may be present in the volume lying 
between 300mm and 700mm forward of the plane C-C, and between 50mm and 600mm </p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>above the reference plane, and outboard of a plane 280mm inboard of the outermost 
longitudinal vertical cross section of the impact structures. 
</p>
<p>15.5.3 An impact absorbing structure must be fitted behind the gearbox symmetrically about the car 
centre plane with the centre of area of its rearmost face 300mm (+/-5mm) above the 
reference plane and no less than 575mm behind the rear wheel centre line. 
</p>
<p> The rearmost face of the impact structure must be a rectangular section no less than 100mm 
wide, this minimum width must be maintained over a height of at least 130mm and each 
corner may incorporate a radius no greater than 10mm. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, when viewed from the side, the lowest and highest points of the impact 
absorbing structure between its rear face and 50mm aft of the rear wheel centre line may not 
be separated vertically by more than 275 mm. 
</p>
<p> Between the rear face and the rear wheel centre line no dimension of the area thus defined 
may diminish nor may any part of the structure or gearbox which is visible from below, other 
than the permitted radii, be higher than the lower edge of the rear face. Pockets of minimum 
size within the structure are permitted for the sole purpose of attaching suspension members. 
</p>
<p> This structure must pass an impact test and must be constructed from materials which will not 
be substantially affected by the temperatures it is likely to be subjected to during use. Details 
of the test procedure may be found in Article 16.4. 
</p>
<p> In order to minimise the likelihood of the structure penetrating a survival cell, it must be 
designed so that the majority of its material lies evenly around its perimeter. Therefore, the 
perimeter of every vertical cross section between points 50mm forward of its rear face and 
200mm forward of its rear face must be of a uniform construction and, with the exception of 
minimal local changes for attachments, have a minimum thickness of 1.75mm. Material with a 
specific gravity of less than 1 will not be considered when calculating these thicknesses and, 
furthermore, any internal structure must not be thicker than any part of the perimeter at that 
section. 
</p>
<p> Only those parts of the structure which genuinely contribute to its performance during the 
impact test, and which are designed and fitted for that sole purpose, will be considered when 
assessing compliance with any of the above. 
</p>
<p>15.5.4 The survival cell must also be subjected to five separate static load tests : 
</p>
<p> 1) On a vertical plane passing through the centre of the fuel tank. 
</p>
<p> 2) On a vertical plane passing through the rearmost point at which the outer end of the 
forward-most front wheel tether would make contact with the survival cell when swung 
about the inner attachment. 
</p>
<p> 3) From beneath the fuel tank. 
</p>
<p> 4) On each side of the cockpit opening. 
</p>
<p> 5) From beneath the cockpit floor. 
</p>
<p> Details of the test procedures may be found in Article 18.2, 18.3, 18.4 and 18.5. 
</p>
<p>15.5.5 To test the attachments of the frontal, side and rear impact absorbing structures static side 
load tests must be carried out. Details of these test procedures may be found in Articles 18.6, 
18.8 and 18.9.2. 
</p>
<p> 
15.5.6 An impact absorbing structure must be fitted in front of the survival cell. This structure need 
</p>
<p>not be an integral part of the survival cell but must be solidly attached to it and be arranged 
symmetrically about the car centre plane. 
</p>
<p> No part of this structure may lie more than 525mm above the reference plane and its forward-
most point must not be less than 1050mm forward of the front wheel centre line. </p>

100mm vertically below this point, may be considered. 
</p>
<p> Each external vertical cross-section, taken on planes parallel to the plane C-C between the 
plane E-E and 150mm forward of the front wheel centre line, must be a single section with an 
area which exceeds a value given by a linear taper from 20000mm² to 60000mm² respectively.

<p>ARTICLE 16 : IMPACT TESTING 
</p>
<p>16.1 Conditions applicable to all impact tests : 
</p>
<p>16.1.1 All tests must be carried out in accordance with FIA Test Procedure 01/00, in the presence of 
an FIA technical delegate and by using measuring equipment which has been calibrated to the 
satisfaction of the FIA technical delegate. A copy of the test procedure may be found in the 
Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p>16.1.2 Any significant modification introduced into any of the structures tested shall require that part 
to pass a further test. 
</p>
<p>16.2 Frontal test 1 : 
</p>
<p> To simulate in-car conditions, all parts which could materially affect the outcome of the test 
must be fitted to the test structure which must be solidly fixed to the trolley through the 
mounting points of the nose structure, but not in such a way as to increase its impact 
resistance. 
</p>
<p> If the test facility includes a system to manage excess residual energy (in the event that the 
nose structure fails to absorb all the test energy), such a system must not in any way modify 
the results during a successful test. 
</p>
<p> For the purposes of this test, the total weight of the trolley and test structure shall be 
780kg (+1%/-0) and the velocity of impact not less than 15 metres/second. 
</p>
<p> The resistance of the test structure must be such that during the impact either : 
</p>
<p> a) The peak deceleration over the first 100mm of deformation does not 
exceed 10g. 
</p>
<p> b) The peak permissible deceleration increases linearly from 10g at 100mm to

<p>ARTICLE 19 : FUEL 
</p>
<p>19.1 Purpose of Article 19 : 
</p>
<p>19.1.1 The purpose of this Article is to ensure that the fuel used in Formula One is petrol as this term 
is generally understood. 
</p>
<p>19.1.2 The detailed requirements of this Article are intended to ensure the use of fuels that are 
composed of compounds normally found in commercial fuels and to prohibit the use of 
specific power-boosting chemical compounds. Acceptable compounds and compound classes 
are defined in 19.2 and 19.4.3. In addition, to cover the presence of low level impurities, the 
sum of components lying outside the 19.2 and 19.4.3 definitions are limited to 1% max m/m of 
the total fuel. 
</p>
<p>19.1.3 Any petrol, which appears to have been formulated in order to subvert the purpose of this 
regulation, will be deemed to be outside it. 
</p>
<p>19.2 Definitions : 
</p>
<p> Paraffins - Straight chain and branched alkanes. 
</p>
<p> Olefins - Straight chain and branched mono-olefins and di-olefins. 
</p>
<p>- Monocyclic mono-olefins (with five or more carbon atoms in the ring) with 
or without paraffinic side chains. 
</p>
<p> Di-olefins - Straight chain or branched or monocyclic hydrocarbons (with five or more 
carbon atoms in any ring) with or without paraffinic side chains, containing 
two double bonds per molecule. 
</p>
<p> Naphthenes - Monocyclic alkanes (with five or more carbon atoms in the ring) with or 
without paraffinic side chains. 
</p>
<p> Aromatics - Monocyclic and bicyclic aromatic rings with or without paraffinic side

<p> Oxygenates - Organic compounds containing oxygen. 
</p>
<p> Biocomponents - Paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, aromatics and oxygenates, as defined above, 
derived in whole or part from biological origins. For the purposes of 
quantification, the biocomponent contribution of a given molecule is 
defined as the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms from biological origin as 
a percent of the total molecule, on a mass/mass basis. The biocomponent

copy of which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations. 
</p>
<p>19.8.2 Fuel density will also be checked and must be within 0.25% of the figure noted during pre-
approval analysis. 
</p>
<p>19.8.3 Fuel samples taken during an Event will be checked for conformity by using a gas 
chromatographic technique, which will compare the sample taken with an approved fuel. 
Samples which differ from the approved fuel in a manner consistent with evaporative loss, will 
be considered to conform. However, the FIA retains the right to subject the fuel sample to 
further testing at an FIA approved laboratory. 
</p>
<p>19.8.4 GC peak areas of the sample will be compared with those obtained from the reference fuel. 
Increases in any given peak area (relative to its adjacent peak areas) which are greater than

</p>
<p>ARTICLE 20 : ENGINE OIL 
</p>
<p>20.1 Purpose of Article 20 : 
</p>
<p>20.1.1 The purpose of this Article is to ensure that the engine oil used in Formula One is engine oil as 
this term is generally understood. The function of an engine oil is to lubricate moving parts, to 
improve the overall efficiency of the engine by reducing friction and to reduce wear. It also 
cleans, inhibits corrosion, improves sealing, and cools the engine by carrying heat away from 
moving parts. Engine oils should not enhance the properties of the fuel nor energize the 
combustion. The presence of any component that cannot be rationally associated with the 
defined functions of the engine oil will be deemed unacceptable. 
</p>
<p>20.1.2 Any engine oil, which appears to have been formulated in order to subvert the purpose of this 
regulation, will be deemed to be outside it. 
</p>
<p>20.2 Definitions : 
</p>
<p> Engine oil Fluid serving the purpose of Article 20.1 and comprising base oils and additives as 
defined below. 
</p>
<p> Base Oil General : 
</p>
<p> a) A base oil is a base stock or blend of base stocks. 
</p>
<p> b) A base stock is a lubricant component that is produced by a single 
manufacturer. Base stocks may be manufactured using a variety of 
different processes including but not limited to distillation, solvent refining, 
hydrogen processing, oligomerization, esterification, and re-refining. 
</p>
<p>  Base stock categories : 
</p>
<p>  All base stocks are divided into five general categories : 
</p>
<p> a) Group I base stocks contain less than 90 percent saturates and/or greater 
than 0.03 percent sulfur and have a viscosity index greater than or equal to 
80 and less than 120 using the test methods specified in Table 20.1. 
</p>
<p> b) Group II base stocks contain greater than or equal to 90 percent saturates 
and less than or equal to 0.03 percent sulfur and have a viscosity index 
greater than or equal to 80 and less than 120 using the test methods 
specified in Table 20.1. 
</p>
<p> c) Group III base stocks contain greater than or equal to 90 percent saturates 
and less than or equal to 0.03 percent sulfur and have a viscosity index 
greater than or equal to 120 using the test methods specified in Table 20.1. 
</p>
<p> d) Group IV base stocks are polyalphaolefins (PAO). 
</p>
<p> e) Group V base stocks include all other base stocks not included in Group I, II, 
III, or IV.

</p>
<p> Additives Additives are chemical compounds added to the base oil in small concentrations 
that improve the performance characteristics of the engine oil. 
</p>
<p>20.3 Properties : 
</p>
<p> The engine oil must comply with the following characteristics : 
</p>
<p> Property Units Min Max Test Method 
</p>
<p> Kinematic Viscosity (100oC) cSt 2.8  ASTM D445 
</p>
<p> HTHS Viscosity at 150oC 
</p>
<p> and Shear Rate of 106 s-1 mPa.s 1.4  ASTM D4741 
</p>
<p> Initial Boiling Point oC 210  ASTM D7500 
</p>
<p> Flashpoint oC 93  ASTM D3828 
</p>
<p> The oil will be accepted or rejected according to ASTM D 3244 with a confidence limit of 95%. 
</p>
<p>20.4 Composition of the engine oil : 
</p>
<p>20.4.1 In the event that the initial boiling point test (ASTM D7500) suggests the presence of 
compounds with a boiling point of less than 210°C the sample will be further analysed by 
GCMS. The total of any components with boiling points less than 210°C must not exceed 0.5% 
m/m. 
</p>
<p>20.4.2 The engine oil must not contain any organo-metallic petrol additives or other octane boosting 
petrol additives. 
</p>
<p>20.5 Safety : 
</p>
<p>20.5.1 All competitors must be in possession of a Material Safety Data Sheet for each type of engine 
oil used. This sheet must be made out in accordance with EC Directive 93/112/EEC or US 
equivalent and all information contained therein strictly adhered to. 
</p>
<p>20.6 Engine oil approval : 
</p>
<p>20.6.1 Before any engine oil may be used in an Event, two separate one-litre samples, in suitable 
containers, must be submitted to the FIA for analysis and approval. 
</p>
<p>20.6.2 No engine oil may be used in an Event without prior written approval of the FIA. 
</p>
<p>20.7 Sampling and testing at an Event : 
</p>
<p>20.7.1 Each competitor must declare, prior to every Event, which oil will be used in each of their 
engines during the Event. 
</p>
<p>20.7.2 For reference purposes, before any oil may be used at an Event, a sample must be submitted 
to the FIA together with the oil reference number. 
</p>
<p>20.7.3 No competitor may use more than one oil in a given engine during an Event. 
</p>
<p>20.7.4 Engine oil samples taken during an Event will be checked for conformity by using a fourier 
transform infrared (FTIR) technique, which will compare the sample taken with that submitted 
at the start of the event. Samples which differ from the reference engine oil in a manner 
consistent with fuel dilution, engine fluids contamination and oil ageing as a result of normal 
engine operation, will be considered to conform. Samples which differ from the reference 
engine oil in a manner consistent with the mixing with other engine oils, which have been 
approved by the FIA for use by the team, will be deemed to comply, provided that the 
adulterant oils are in total present at no more than 10% in the sample. However, the FIA 
retains the right to subject the oil sample to further testing at an FIA approved laboratory. </p>
